| **[NavQ: Learning a Q-Model for Foresighted Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16457v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[SUM-AgriVLN: Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14357v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural robots are emerging as powerful assistants across a wide range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or fixed rail systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation (SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules.

We present HA-VLN 2.0, a unified benchmark introducing explicit social-awareness constraints. Our contributions are: (i) a standardized task and metrics capturing both goal accuracy and personal-space adherence; (ii) HAPS 2.0 dataset and simulators modeling multi-human interactions, outdoor contexts, and finer language-motion alignment; (iii) benchmarks on 16,844 socially grounded instructions, revealing sharp performance drops of leading agents under human dynamics and partial observability; and (iv) real-world robot experiments validating sim-to-real transfer, with an open leaderboard enabling transparent comparison. Results show that explicit social modeling improves navigation robustness and reduces collisions, underscoring the necessity of human-centric approaches. By releasing datasets, simulators, baselines, and protocols, HA-VLN 2.0 provides a strong foundation for safe, socially responsible navigation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 20 figures, website: https://ha-vln-project.vercel.app/</p></details> |
| **[Dream to Recall: Imagination-Guided Experience Retrieval for Memory-Persistent Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08553v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1) a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this imagination-guided paradigm.

| **[Breaking Down and Building Up: Mixture of Skill-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07642v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges for agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents. Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills (e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each handled by a specialized agent. To support targeted skill training without manual data annotation, we construct a synthetic dataset pipeline that generates diverse, linguistically natural, skill-specific instruction-trajectory pairs. We then introduce a novel training-free Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations and historical actions. SkillNav obtains competitive results on commonly used benchmarks and establishes state-of-the-art generalization to the GSA-R2R, a benchmark with novel instruction styles and unseen environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Landmark-Guided Knowledge for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25655v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism, which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by International Conference on Intelligent Computing 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-and-Language Navigation with Analogical Textual Descriptions in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25139v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[See, Point, Fly: A Learning-Free VLM Framework for Universal Unmanned Aerial Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22653v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

| **[JanusVLN: Decoupling Semantics and Spatiality with Dual Implicit Memory for Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22548v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided, enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

| **[Rethinking the Embodied Gap in Vision-and-Language Navigation: A Holistic Study of Physical and Visual Disparities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13019v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models.

| **[Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges. For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering, we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025.

| **[T-araVLN: Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06644v4)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide range of agricultural tasks, however, still heavily rely on manual operation or fixed railways for movement. To address this limitation, the AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, but often misunderstands the complex ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be more refined and precise. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

| **[Embodied Navigation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12129v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |
| **[ActiveVLN: Towards Active Exploration via Multi-Turn RL in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12618v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments. Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamNav: A Trajectory-Based Imaginative Framework for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11197v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and 18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[GC-VLN: Instruction as Graph Constraints for Training-free Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10454v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges, which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple solutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world experiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new environments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and autonomous navigation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025.

| **[MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[UAV-ON: A Benchmark for Open-World Object Goal Navigation with Aerial Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00288v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM Dataset Track 2025</p></details> |

However, due to the extended trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning, and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising 13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets. To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal coordinate information to ensure efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

However, these models lack effective error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set, uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2% and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and long instruction following.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Input-Adaptive Inference for Efficient VLN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09262v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/secure-ai-systems-group/adaptive-vision-and-language-navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 [Poster]</p></details> |

However, it remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in aerial scenes.In this paper, we propose a training-free, zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is leveraged as the agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks onto a top-down map, which presents spatial and topological information about surrounding landmarks and grows during the navigation process. At each step, a local map centered at the UAV is extracted from the growing top-down map, and transformed into a ma trix representation with distance metrics, serving as the text prompt to LLM for action prediction in response to the given instruction. Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving absolute success rate improvements of 26.8% and 5.8% over current state-of-the-art methods on simple and complex navigation tasks, respectively. The dataset and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) enables robots to navigate to the target destinations following natural language instructions, demonstrating strong performance on several domains. However, none of the existing benchmarks or methods is specifically designed for agricultural scenes. To bridge this gap, we propose Agriculture to Agriculture (A2A) benchmark, containing 1,560 episodes across six diverse agricultural scenes, in which all realistic RGB videos are captured by front-facing camera on a quadruped robot at a height of 0.38 meters, aligning with the practical deployment conditions. Meanwhile, we propose Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots (AgriVLN) baseline based on Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompted with carefully crafted templates, which can understand both given instructions and agricultural environments to generate appropriate low-level actions for robot control. When evaluated on A2A, AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles with long instructions, because it often fails to track which part of the instruction is currently being executed. To address this, we further propose Subtask List (STL) instruction decomposition module and integrate it into AgriVLN, improving Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47. We additionally compare AgriVLN with several existing VLN methods, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.</p></details> |  |

While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind models specifically designed for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICNSLP 2025</p></details> |

While recent cross-modal training approaches have significantly improved navigation performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, aerial navigation over real-world cities remains underexplored primarily due to limited datasets and the difficulty of integrating visual and geographic information. To fill this gap, we introduce CityNav, the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial VLN. Our dataset consists of 32,637 human demonstration trajectories, each paired with a natural language description, covering 4.65 km$^2$ across two real cities: Cambridge and Birmingham. In contrast to existing datasets composed of synthetic scenes such as AerialVLN, our dataset presents a unique challenge because agents must interpret spatial relationships between real-world landmarks and the navigation destination, making CityNav an essential benchmark for advancing aerial VLN. Furthermore, as an initial step toward addressing this challenge, we provide a methodology of creating geographic semantic maps that can be used as an auxiliary modality input during navigation. In our experiments, we compare performance of three representative aerial VLN agents (Seq2seq, CMA and AerialVLN models) and demonstrate that the semantic map representation significantly improves their navigation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV2025.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation (VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic 3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance, ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements.

While Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding, long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision, language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues, while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse, supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost. Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world deployment.

This allows them to rapidly approach objects and perform a wide range of tasks often challenging for ground robots, making them ideal for exploration, inspection, aerial imaging, and everyday assistance. In this paper, we introduce AirStar, a UAV-centric embodied platform that turns a UAV into an intelligent aerial assistant: a large language model acts as the cognitive core for environmental understanding, contextual reasoning, and task planning. AirStar accepts natural interaction through voice commands and gestures, removing the need for a remote controller and significantly broadening its user base. It combines geospatial knowledge-driven long-distance navigation with contextual reasoning for fine-grained short-range control, resulting in an efficient and accurate vision-and-language navigation (VLN) capability.Furthermore, the system also offers built-in capabilities such as cross-modal question answering, intelligent filming, and target tracking.

| **[World-Consistent Data Generation for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06413v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task that requires an agent to navigate through photorealistic environments following natural-language instructions. One main obstacle existing in VLN is data scarcity, leading to poor generalization performance over unseen environments. Though data argumentation is a promising way for scaling up the dataset, how to generate VLN data both diverse and world-consistent remains problematic. To cope with this issue, we propose the world-consistent data generation (WCGEN), an efficacious data-augmentation framework satisfying both diversity and world-consistency, aimed at enhancing the generalization of agents to novel environments. Roughly, our framework consists of two stages, the trajectory stage which leverages a point-cloud based technique to ensure spatial coherency among viewpoints, and the viewpoint stage which adopts a novel angle synthesis method to guarantee spatial and wraparound consistency within the entire observation. By accurately predicting viewpoint changes with 3D knowledge, our approach maintains the world-consistency during the generation procedure. Experiments on a wide range of datasets verify the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating that our data augmentation strategy enables agents to achieve new state-of-the-art results on all navigation tasks, and is capable of enhancing the VLN agents' generalization ability to unseen environments.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.

Two key bottlenecks remain in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM) that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover, real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the presence of abstract language input.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |

Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity.

Unlike existing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) methods designed for general agents in unknown environments, our approach specifically targets the efficient inspection of known scenes, with widespread applications in fields such as medical, marine, and civil engineering. Leveraging VLMs, our method first extracts points of interest (POIs) from the text description, then identifies a set of waypoints from which POIs are both salient and align with the spatial constraints defined in the prompt. Next, we interact with the VLM to iteratively refine the trajectory, preserving the visibility and prominence of the POIs. Further, we solve a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the most efficient visitation order that satisfies the order constraint implied in the text description. Finally, we apply trajectory optimization to generate smooth, executable inspection paths for aerial and underwater vehicles. We have evaluated our method across a series of both handcrafted and real-world scanned environments.

While foundational models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service (QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects. Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in physical-world deployments.</p></details> | Under review |

We design a two-stage training pipeline: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using high-quality demonstrations to improve initialization and structured reasoning; then, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, guided by a composite reward that considers goal accuracy, reasoning quality, and format compliance, to enhance generalization and adaptability. Furthermore, FlightGPT introduces a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning mechanism to improve decision interpretability. Extensive experiments on the city-scale dataset CityNav demonstrate that FlightGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across all scenarios, with a 9.22\% higher success rate than the strongest baseline in unseen environments.

However, MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms and trigger undesired outputs. In embodied scenarios, such vulnerabilities pose greater risks: unlike plain text models that generate toxic content, embodied agents may interpret malicious instructions as executable commands, potentially leading to real-world harm. In this paper, we present the first systematic jailbreak attack paradigm targeting MLLM-driven navigator. We propose a three-tiered attack framework and construct malicious queries across four intent categories, concatenated with standard navigation instructions. In the Matterport3D simulator, we evaluate navigation agents powered by five MLLMs and report an average attack success rate over 90%. To test real-world feasibility, we replicate the attack on a physical robot. Our results show that even well-crafted prompts can induce harmful actions and intents in MLLMs, posing risks beyond toxic output and potentially leading to physical harm.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Many existing VLN approaches typically follow an 'observe-and-reason' schema, that is, agents observe the environment and decide on the next action to take based on the visual observations of their surroundings. They often face challenges in long-horizon scenarios due to limitations in immediate observation and vision-language modality gaps. To overcome this, we present VISTA, a novel framework that employs an 'imagine-and-align' navigation strategy. Specifically, we leverage the generative prior of pre-trained diffusion models for dynamic visual imagination conditioned on both local observations and high-level language instructions. A Perceptual Alignment Filter module then grounds these goal imaginations against current observations, guiding an interpretable and structured reasoning process for action selection. Experiments show that VISTA sets new state-of-the-art results on Room-to-Room (R2R) and RoboTHOR benchmarks, e.g.,+3.6% increase in Success Rate on R2R. Extensive ablation analysis underscores the value of integrating forward-looking imagination, perceptual alignment, and structured reasoning for robust navigation in long-horizon environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Recently, video-language large models (Video-VLMs) with strong generalization capabilities and rich commonsense knowledge have shown remarkable performance when applied to VLN tasks. However, these models still encounter the following challenges when applied to real-world 3D navigation: 1) Insufficient understanding of 3D geometry and spatial semantics; 2) Limited capacity for large-scale exploration and long-term environmental memory; 3) Poor adaptability to dynamic and changing environments.To address these limitations, we propose Dynam3D, a dynamic layered 3D representation model that leverages language-aligned, generalizable, and hierarchical 3D representations as visual input to train 3D-VLM in navigation action prediction. Given posed RGB-D images, our Dynam3D projects 2D CLIP features into 3D space and constructs multi-level 3D patch-instance-zone representations for 3D geometric and semantic understanding with a dynamic and layer-wise update strategy. Our Dynam3D is capable of online encoding and localization of 3D instances, and dynamically updates them in changing environments to provide large-scale exploration and long-term memory capabilities for navigation. By leveraging large-scale 3D-language pretraining and task-specific adaptation, our Dynam3D sets new state-of-the-art performance on VLN benchmarks including R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE and NavRAG-CE under monocular settings. Furthermore, experiments for pre-exploration, lifelong memory, and real-world robot validate the effectiveness of practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CityNavAgent: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Semantic Planning and Global Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05622v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

The agent must accurately locate the target based on visual information from the environment and complete tasks through interaction with the surroundings. Despite significant advancements in this field, two major limitations persist: (1) Many existing methods input complete language instructions directly into multi-layer Transformer networks without fully exploiting the detailed information within the instructions, thereby limiting the agent's language understanding capabilities during task execution; (2) Current approaches often overlook the modeling of object relationships across different modalities, failing to effectively utilize latent clues between objects, which affects the accuracy and robustness of navigation decisions. We propose a Dual Object Perception-Enhancement Network (DOPE) to address these issues to improve navigation performance. First, we design a Text Semantic Extraction (TSE) to extract relatively essential phrases from the text and input them into the Text Object Perception-Augmentation (TOPA) to fully leverage details such as objects and actions within the instructions. Second, we introduce an Image Object Perception-Augmentation (IOPA), which performs additional modeling of object information across different modalities, enabling the model to more effectively utilize latent clues between objects in images and text, enhancing decision-making accuracy.

While prior methods often rely on either global scene representations or object-level features, these approaches are insufficient for capturing the complex interactions across modalities required for accurate navigation. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Fusion and Reasoning Architecture (MFRA) to enhance the agent's ability to reason over visual observations, language instructions and navigation history. Specifically, MFRA introduces a hierarchical fusion mechanism that aggregates multi-level features-ranging from low-level visual cues to high-level semantic concepts-across multiple modalities. We further design a reasoning module that leverages fused representations to infer navigation actions through instruction-guided attention and dynamic context integration. By selectively capturing and combining relevant visual, linguistic, and temporal signals, MFRA improves decision-making accuracy in complex navigation scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark VLN datasets including REVERIE, R2R, and SOON demonstrate that MFRA achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of multi-level modal fusion for embodied navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Compared to discrete settings, VLN-CE poses two core perception challenges. First, the absence of predefined observation points leads to heterogeneous visual memories and weakened global spatial correlations. Second, cumulative reconstruction errors in three-dimensional scenes introduce structural noise, impairing local feature perception. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ST-Booster, an iterative spatiotemporal booster that enhances navigation performance through multi-granularity perception and instruction-aware reasoning. ST-Booster consists of three key modules -- Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Encoding (HSTE), Multi-Granularity Aligned Fusion (MGAF), and ValueGuided Waypoint Generation (VGWG). HSTE encodes long-term global memory using topological graphs and captures shortterm local details via grid maps. MGAF aligns these dualmap representations with instructions through geometry-aware knowledge fusion. The resulting representations are iteratively refined through pretraining tasks. During reasoning, VGWG generates Guided Attention Heatmaps (GAHs) to explicitly model environment-instruction relevance and optimize waypoint selection. Extensive comparative experiments and performance analyses are conducted, demonstrating that ST-Booster outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex, disturbance-prone environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Although significant progress has been made in simulated environments, directly transferring these capabilities to real-world scenarios often results in severe hallucination phenomena, causing robots to lose effective spatial awareness. To address this issue, we propose BrainNav, a bio-inspired spatial cognitive navigation framework inspired by biological spatial cognition theories and cognitive map theory. BrainNav integrates dual-map (coordinate map and topological map) and dual-orientation (relative orientation and absolute orientation) strategies, enabling real-time navigation through dynamic scene capture and path planning. Its five core modules-Hippocampal Memory Hub, Visual Cortex Perception Engine, Parietal Spatial Constructor, Prefrontal Decision Center, and Cerebellar Motion Execution Unit-mimic biological cognitive functions to reduce spatial hallucinations and enhance adaptability. Validated in a zero-shot real-world lab environment using the Limo Pro robot, BrainNav, compatible with GPT-4, outperforms existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) methods without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, underutilizing latent textual semantic and spatial cues and leaving the modality gap between instructions and scarce environmental representations unresolved. Intuitively, humans inherently ground semantic knowledge within spatial layouts during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to encourage agents to ground environment from diverse perspectives. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experiments demonstrate that SUSA's hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON).

Many contemporary VLN approaches, while based on transformer architectures, have increasingly incorporated additional components such as external knowledge bases or map information to enhance performance. These additions, while boosting performance, also lead to larger models and increased computational costs. In this paper, to achieve both high performance and low computational costs, we propose a novel architecture with the COmbination of Selective MemOrization (COSMO). Specifically, COSMO integrates state-space modules and transformer modules, and incorporates two VLN-customized selective state space modules: the Round Selective Scan (RSS) and the Cross-modal Selective State Space Module (CS3). RSS facilitates comprehensive inter-modal interactions within a single scan, while the CS3 module adapts the selective state space module into a dual-stream architecture, thereby enhancing the acquisition of cross-modal interactions. Experimental validations on three mainstream VLN benchmarks, REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE, not only demonstrate competitive navigation performance of our model but also show a significant reduction in computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

In this work, we study if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize these visual representations or imaginations, we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of around 1 point and up to 0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on language instructions alone.

To address this, we introduce RoomTour3D, a video-instruction dataset derived from web-based room tour videos that capture real-world indoor spaces and human walking demonstrations. Unlike existing VLN datasets, RoomTour3D leverages the scale and diversity of online videos to generate open-ended human walking trajectories and open-world navigable instructions. To compensate for the lack of navigation data in online videos, we perform 3D reconstruction and obtain 3D trajectories of walking paths augmented with additional information on the room types, object locations and 3D shape of surrounding scenes. Our dataset includes $\sim$100K open-ended description-enriched trajectories with $\sim$200K instructions, and 17K action-enriched trajectories from 1847 room tour environments. We demonstrate experimentally that RoomTour3D enables significant improvements across multiple VLN tasks including CVDN, SOON, R2R, and REVERIE. Moreover, RoomTour3D facilitates the development of trainable zero-shot VLN agents, showcasing the potential and challenges of advancing towards open-world navigation.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

Despite remarkable advancements in recent years, most methods necessitate dataset-specific training, thereby lacking the capability to generalize across diverse datasets encompassing distinct types of instructions. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning and generalization abilities, exhibiting immense potential in robot action planning. In this paper, we propose FlexVLN, an innovative hierarchical approach to VLN that integrates the fundamental navigation ability of a supervised-learning-based Instruction Follower with the robust generalization ability of the LLM Planner, enabling effective generalization across diverse VLN datasets. Moreover, a verification mechanism and a multi-model integration mechanism are proposed to mitigate potential hallucinations by the LLM Planner and enhance execution accuracy of the Instruction Follower. We take REVERIE, SOON, and CVDN-target as out-of-domain datasets for assessing generalization ability. The generalization performance of FlexVLN surpasses that of all the previous methods to a large extent.</p></details> |  |

One of the problems of the VLN task is data scarcity since it is difficult to collect enough navigation paths with human-annotated instructions for interactive environments. In this paper, we explore the use of counterfactual thinking as a human-inspired data augmentation method that results in robust models. Counterfactual thinking is a concept that describes the human propensity to create possible alternatives to life events that have already occurred. We propose an adversarial-driven counterfactual reasoning model that can consider effective conditions instead of low-quality augmented data. In particular, we present a model-agnostic adversarial path sampler (APS) that learns to sample challenging paths that force the navigator to improve based on the navigation performance. APS also serves to do pre-exploration of unseen environments to strengthen the model's ability to generalize. We evaluate the influence of APS on the performance of different VLN baseline models using the room-to-room dataset (R2R). The results show that the adversarial training process with our proposed APS benefits VLN models under both seen and unseen environments. And the pre-exploration process can further gain additional improvements under unseen environments.</p></details> | ECCV'20 (Spotlight) |

In contrast to navigation in discrete environments with predefined trajectories, VLN in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents greater challenges, as the agent is free to navigate any unobstructed location and is more vulnerable to visual occlusions or blind spots. Recent approaches have attempted to address this by imagining future environments, either through predicted future visual images or semantic features, rather than relying solely on current observations. However, these RGB-based and feature-based methods lack intuitive appearance-level information or high-level semantic complexity crucial for effective navigation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable 3DGS-based pre-training paradigm, called UnitedVLN, which enables agents to better explore future environments by unitedly rendering high-fidelity 360 visual images and semantic features. UnitedVLN employs two key schemes: search-then-query sampling and separate-then-united rendering, which facilitate efficient exploitation of neural primitives, helping to integrate both appearance and semantic information for more robust navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnitedVLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing VLN-CE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Compared to ground-based VLN, aerial VLN requires the agent to decide the next action in both horizontal and vertical directions based on the first-person view observations. Previous methods struggle to perform well due to the longer navigation path, more complicated 3D scenes, and the neglect of the interplay between vertical and horizontal actions. In this paper, we propose a novel grid-based view selection framework that formulates aerial VLN action prediction as a grid-based view selection task, incorporating vertical action prediction in a manner that accounts for the coupling with horizontal actions, thereby enabling effective altitude adjustments. We further introduce a grid-based bird's eye view map for aerial space to fuse the visual information in the navigation history, provide contextual scene information, and mitigate the impact of obstacles. Finally, a cross-modal transformer is adopted to explicitly align the long navigation history with the instruction. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in extensive experiments.</p></details> | Under Submission |

However, existing methods often struggle with effectively integrating visual observations and instruction details during navigation, leading to suboptimal path planning and limited success rates. In this paper, we propose OIKG (Observation-graph Interaction and Key-detail Guidance), a novel framework that addresses these limitations through two key components: (1) an observation-graph interaction module that decouples angular and visual information while strengthening edge representations in the navigation space, and (2) a key-detail guidance module that dynamically extracts and utilizes fine-grained location and object information from instructions. By enabling more precise cross-modal alignment and dynamic instruction interpretation, our approach significantly improves the agent's ability to follow complex navigation instructions. Extensive experiments on the R2R and RxR datasets demonstrate that OIKG achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing navigation precision through better observation-instruction alignment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, the scarcity of training data impedes progress in this field. This paper introduces PanoGen++, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by generating varied and pertinent panoramic environments for VLN tasks. PanoGen++ incorporates pre-trained diffusion models with domain-specific fine-tuning, employing parameter-efficient techniques such as low-rank adaptation to minimize computational costs. We investigate two settings for environment generation: masked image inpainting and recursive image outpainting. The former maximizes novel environment creation by inpainting masked regions based on textual descriptions, while the latter facilitates agents' learning of spatial relationships within panoramas. Empirical evaluations on room-to-room (R2R), room-for-room (R4R), and cooperative vision-and-dialog navigation (CVDN) datasets reveal significant performance enhancements: a 2.44% increase in success rate on the R2R test leaderboard, a 0.63% improvement on the R4R validation unseen set, and a 0.75-meter enhancement in goal progress on the CVDN validation unseen set.

High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM. We annotate over 2 million navigation instructions across 861 scenes and evaluate the data quality and navigation performance of trained models.</p></details> |  |

However, generalization remains a persistent challenge, particularly when dealing with visually diverse scenes or transitioning from simulated environments to real-world deployment. In this paper, we address the mismatch between human-centric instructions and quadruped robots with a low-height field of view, proposing a Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVNav) approach to mitigate this issue. This work represents the first attempt to highlight the generalization gap in VLN across varying heights of visual observation in realistic robot deployments. Our approach leverages weighted historical observations as enriched spatiotemporal contexts for instruction following, effectively managing feature collisions within cells by assigning appropriate weights to identical features across different viewpoints. This enables low-height robots to overcome challenges such as visual obstructions and perceptual mismatches. Additionally, we transfer the connectivity graph from the HM3D and Gibson datasets as an extra resource to enhance spatial priors and a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance and generalizability of the waypoint predictor in real-world environments.

Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA, NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a visual locomotion RL policy for execution.

However, real-world navigation robots often operate in persistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual observations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task setting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating continuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these real-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN, a novel task requiring agents to execute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously adapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task, one has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of OOD data, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each scene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly expands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the R2R dataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts. Furthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that leverages LLMs to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing techniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is motivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent signatures or preferences in their instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various methods. Based on our findings, we propose a novel method, GR-DUET, which incorporates memory-based navigation graphs with an environment-specific training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on all GSA-R2R splits.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While LLMs excel in general conversation scenarios, they struggle with specialized navigation tasks, yielding suboptimal performance compared to specialized VLN models. We introduce FLAME (FLAMingo-Architected Embodied Agent), a novel Multimodal LLM-based agent and architecture designed for urban VLN tasks that efficiently handles multiple observations. Our approach implements a three-phase tuning technique for effective adaptation to navigation tasks, including single perception tuning for street view description, multiple perception tuning for route summarization, and end-to-end training on VLN datasets. The augmented datasets are synthesized automatically. Experimental results demonstrate FLAME's superiority over existing methods, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a 7.3% increase in task completion on Touchdown dataset. This work showcases the potential of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in complex navigation tasks, representing an advancement towards applications of MLLMs in the field of embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

Developing an imaginative memory system inspired by human mechanisms can enhance the navigation performance of embodied agents in unseen environments. However, existing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents lack a memory mechanism of this kind. To address this, we propose a novel architecture that equips agents with a reality-imagination hybrid memory system. This system enables agents to maintain and expand their memory through both imaginative mechanisms and navigation actions. Additionally, we design tailored pre-training tasks to develop the agent's imaginative capabilities. Our agent can imagine high-fidelity RGB images for future scenes, achieving state-of-the-art result in Success rate weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15049v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In developing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents that navigate to a destination using natural language instructions and visual cues, current studies largely assume a \textit{train-once-deploy-once strategy}. We argue that this kind of strategy is less realistic, as deployed VLN agents are expected to encounter novel environments continuously through their lifetime. To facilitate more realistic setting for VLN agents, we propose Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation (CVLN) paradigm for agents to continually learn and adapt to changing environments. In CVLN, the agents are trained and evaluated incrementally across multiple \textit{scene domains} (i.e., environments). We present two CVLN learning setups to consider diverse forms of natural language instructions: Initial-instruction based CVLN, focused on navigation via initial-instruction interpretation, and dialogue-based CVLN, designed for navigation through dialogue with other agents. We introduce two simple yet effective baseline methods, tailored to the sequential decision-making needs of CVLN: Perplexity Replay (PerpR) and Episodic Self-Replay (ESR), both employing a rehearsal mechanism. PerpR selects replay episodes based on episode difficulty, while ESR stores and revisits action logits from individual episode steps during training to refine learning. Experimental results indicate that while existing continual learning methods are insufficient for CVLN, PerpR and ESR outperform the comparison methods by effectively utilizing replay memory.</p></details> |  |

The paper introduces four core, cognitively motivated and linguistically grounded, navigation concepts and an algorithm for generating large-scale silver annotations of naturally occurring linguistic realizations of these concepts in navigation instructions. We pair the annotated instructions with video clips of an agent acting on these instructions. NAVCON contains 236, 316 concept annotations for approximately 30, 0000 instructions and 2.7 million aligned images (from approximately 19, 000 instructions) showing what the agent sees when executing an instruction. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive resource of navigation concepts. We evaluated the quality of the silver annotations by conducting human evaluation studies on NAVCON samples. As further validation of the quality and usefulness of the resource, we trained a model for detecting navigation concepts and their linguistic realizations in unseen instructions. Additionally, we show that few-shot learning with GPT-4o performs well on this task using large-scale silver annotations of NAVCON.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we consider how this benefit might be hijacked by local modifications in the appearance of the agent's operating environment. Specifically, we take the popular Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task as a representative setting and develop a whitebox adversarial attack that optimizes a 3D attack object's appearance to induce desired behaviors in pretrained VLN agents that observe it in the environment. We demonstrate that the proposed attack can cause VLN agents to ignore their instructions and execute alternative actions after encountering the attack object -- even for instructions and agent paths not considered when optimizing the attack. For these novel settings, we find our attacks can induce early-termination behaviors or divert an agent along an attacker-defined multi-step trajectory. Under both conditions, environmental attacks significantly reduce agent capabilities to successfully follow user instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025</p></details> |

Current approaches use contrastive learning to align language with visual trajectory sequences. Nevertheless, they encounter difficulties with fine-grained vision negatives. To enhance cross-modal embeddings, we introduce a novel Bayesian Optimization-based adversarial optimization framework for creating fine-grained contrastive vision samples. To validate the proposed methodology, we conduct a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness of the enriched embeddings on fine-grained vision negatives. We conduct experiments on two common VLN benchmarks R2R and REVERIE, experiments on the them demonstrate that these embeddings benefit navigation, and can lead to a promising performance enhancement.

Our g3D-LF processes posed RGB-D images from agents to encode feature fields for: 1) Novel view representation predictions from any position in the 3D scene; 2) Generations of BEV maps centered on the agent; 3) Querying targets using multi-granularity language within the above-mentioned representations. Our representation can be generalized to unseen environments, enabling real-time construction and dynamic updates. By volume rendering latent features along sampled rays and integrating semantic and spatial relationships through multiscale encoders, our g3D-LF produces representations at different scales and perspectives, aligned with multi-granularity language, via multi-level contrastive learning. Furthermore, we prepare a large-scale 3D-language dataset to align the representations of the feature fields with language. Extensive experiments on Vision-and-Language Navigation under both Panorama and Monocular settings, Zero-shot Object Navigation, and Situated Question Answering tasks highlight the significant advantages and effectiveness of our g3D-LF for embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstruGen: Automatic Instruction Generation for Vision-and-Language Navigation Via Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11394v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) indicates that agents suffer from poor generalization in unseen environments due to the lack of realistic training environments and high-quality path-instruction pairs. Most existing methods for constructing realistic navigation scenes have high costs, and the extension of instructions mainly relies on predefined templates or rules, lacking adaptability. To alleviate the issue, we propose InstruGen, a VLN path-instruction pairs generation paradigm. Specifically, we use YouTube house tour videos as realistic navigation scenes and leverage the powerful visual understanding and generation abilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) to automatically generate diverse and high-quality VLN path-instruction pairs. Our method generates navigation instructions with different granularities and achieves fine-grained alignment between instructions and visual observations, which was difficult to achieve with previous methods. Additionally, we design a multi-stage verification mechanism to reduce hallucinations and inconsistency of LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate that agents trained with path-instruction pairs generated by InstruGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the R2R and RxR benchmarks, particularly in unseen environments.

| **[NavAgent: Multi-scale Urban Street View Fusion For UAV Embodied Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08579v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a widely discussed research direction in embodied intelligence, aims to enable embodied agents to navigate in complicated visual environments through natural language commands. Most existing VLN methods focus on indoor ground robot scenarios. However, when applied to UAV VLN in outdoor urban scenes, it faces two significant challenges. First, urban scenes contain numerous objects, which makes it challenging to match fine-grained landmarks in images with complex textual descriptions of these landmarks. Second, overall environmental information encompasses multiple modal dimensions, and the diversity of representations significantly increases the complexity of the encoding process. To address these challenges, we propose NavAgent, the first urban UAV embodied navigation model driven by a large Vision-Language Model. NavAgent undertakes navigation tasks by synthesizing multi-scale environmental information, including topological maps (global), panoramas (medium), and fine-grained landmarks (local). Specifically, we utilize GLIP to build a visual recognizer for landmark capable of identifying and linguisticizing fine-grained landmarks. Subsequently, we develop dynamically growing scene topology map that integrate environmental information and employ Graph Convolutional Networks to encode global environmental data. In addition, to train the visual recognizer for landmark, we develop NavAgent-Landmark2K, the first fine-grained landmark dataset for real urban street scenes. In experiments conducted on the Touchdown and Map2seq datasets, NavAgent outperforms strong baseline models. The code and dataset will be released to the community to facilitate the exploration and development of outdoor VLN.</p></details> |  |
| **[To Ask or Not to Ask? Detecting Absence of Information in Vision and Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05831v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in Vision Language Navigation (VLN) has overlooked the development of agents' inquisitive abilities, which allow them to ask clarifying questions when instructions are incomplete. This paper addresses how agents can recognize "when" they lack sufficient information, without focusing on "what" is missing, particularly in VLN tasks with vague instructions. Equipping agents with this ability enhances efficiency by reducing potential digressions and seeking timely assistance. The challenge in identifying such uncertain points is balancing between being overly cautious (high recall) and overly confident (high precision). We propose an attention-based instruction-vagueness estimation module that learns associations between instructions and the agent's trajectory. By leveraging instruction-to-path alignment information during training, the module's vagueness estimation performance improves by around 52% in terms of precision-recall balance. In our ablative experiments, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating this additional instruction-to-path attention network alongside the cross-modal attention networks within the navigator module. Our results show that the attention scores from the instruction-to-path attention network serve as better indicators for estimating vagueness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |

We investigate the relationship between experimenter effort to carry out an evaluation and the resulting estimated test performance as well as the insights that can be drawn from performance on perturbed instances. We use the relative performance change of different contrast set perturbations to characterize policies at reduced experimenter effort in both a simulated manipulation task and a physical robot vision-and-language navigation task. We encourage the use of contrast set evaluations as a more informative alternative to small scale, i.i.d. demonstrations on physical robots, and as a scalable alternative to industry-scale real world evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2024</p></details> |

However, existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and generalization ability of VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures, submitted to ICRA2026</p></details> |

Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://falcon-vla.github.io/</p></details> |

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps, and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 SpaVLE workshop. 4 pages, 2 figures(in main paper, excluding references and supplements)</p></details> |

In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited 3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.</p></details> |  |

Despite their capabilities, VLA systems face significant challenges due to their massive computational and memory demands, which conflict with the constraints of edge platforms such as on-board mobile manipulators that require real-time performance. Addressing this tension has become a central focus of recent research. In light of the growing efforts toward more efficient and scalable VLA systems, this survey provides a systematic review of approaches for improving VLA efficiency, with an emphasis on reducing latency, memory footprint, and training and inference costs. We categorize existing solutions into four dimensions: model architecture, perception feature, action generation, and training/inference strategies, summarizing representative techniques within each category. Finally, we discuss future trends and open challenges, highlighting directions for advancing efficient embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Limits of Vision-Language-Action Manipulations in Cross-task Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15660v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jiaming-zhou.github.io/AGNOSTOS</p></details> |

However, existing approaches often fail out-of-the-box when deployed in novel environments, embodiments, or tasks. We introduce Mixture of Skills VLA (MoS-VLA), a framework that represents robot manipulation policies as linear combinations of a finite set of learned basis functions. During pretraining, MoS-VLA jointly learns these basis functions across datasets from the Open X-Embodiment project, producing a structured skill space. At test time, adapting to a new task requires only a single expert demonstration. The corresponding skill representation is then inferred via a lightweight convex optimization problem that minimizes the L1 action error, without requiring gradient updates. This gradient-free adaptation incurs minimal overhead while enabling rapid instantiation of new skills. Empirically, MoS-VLA achieves lower action-prediction error on five out of five unseen datasets and succeeds in both simulation and real-robot tasks where a pretrained VLA model fails outright.

Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness, and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan, our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model, predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and data diversity.

This challenge is exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research and the development of generalist models. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{NEBULA}, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained \textit{capability tests} for precise skill diagnosis with systematic \textit{stress tests} that measure robustness. A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and fair comparison. Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics.

However, evaluating these policies directly on physical robotic platforms such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) remains hindered by high costs, time demands, reproducibility challenges, and variability in execution. World foundation models (WFM) for physical AI offer a transformative approach to simulate complex real-world surgical tasks, such as soft tissue deformation, with high fidelity. This work introduces Cosmos-Surg-dVRK, a surgical finetune of the Cosmos WFM, which, together with a trained video classifier, enables fully automated online evaluation and benchmarking of surgical policies. We evaluate Cosmos-Surg-dVRK using two distinct surgical datasets. On tabletop suture pad tasks, the automated pipeline achieves strong correlation between online rollouts in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK and policy outcomes on the real dVRK Si platform, as well as good agreement between human labelers and the V-JEPA 2-derived video classifier. Additionally, preliminary experiments with ex-vivo porcine cholecystectomy tasks in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK demonstrate promising alignment with real-world evaluations, highlighting the platform's potential for more complex surgical procedures.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Language to Locomotion: Retargeting-free Humanoid Control via Motion Latent Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14952v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and untrustworthy. They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages. Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking precision, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities such as images, audio, and music, providing a universal foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.</p></details> | 1st version |
| **[VITA-VLA: Efficiently Teaching Vision-Language Models to Act via Action Expert Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09607v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However, training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement), which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://ltbai.github.io/VITA-VLA/</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Forcing: Implicit Spatial Representation Alignment for Vision-language-action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12276v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions. However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on 2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of depth estimators. We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial representations that enhance action precision. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/</p></details> |  |

Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer (RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating robustness across diverse settings.

However, their success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset. To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2 achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any performance degradation on in-domain tasks.

However, existing approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential 3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder, enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expertise need not monopolize: Action-Specialized Mixture of Experts for Vision-Language-Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14300v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and demonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However, scaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new VLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and extensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes particularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights during the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing model capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We propose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits pretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by substituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE employs a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert weighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the traditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance while contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing collaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our approach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through collaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the baseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on LIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement in real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[InternVLA-M1: A Spatially Guided Vision-Language-Action Framework for Generalist Robot Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13778v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs. 93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.</p></details> |  |

Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale, high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over 561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking, the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications, providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task autonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vincentgu2000.github.io/u0project/</p></details> |
| **[Model-agnostic Adversarial Attack and Defense for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13237v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs. Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs. Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates this degradation.

However, the best way to build them remains an open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0 outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data, including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct. These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reflection-Based Task Adaptation for Self-Improving VLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12710v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel, specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and execution. The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration. We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably adapt to new environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

| **[NinA: Normalizing Flows in Action. Training VLA Models with Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16845v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alternative to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/dunnolab/NinA/</p></details> |

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our model in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous driving. This dataset establishes a framework for robust, interpretable, and data-driven autonomous driving systems by providing a comprehensive platform for training and evaluating VLA models, contributing to safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles. The dataset is released for academic purpose.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025, Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/covla-ad/</p></details> |
| **[RoVer: Robot Reward Model as Test-Time Verifier for Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10975v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for embodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on scaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively expensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs. We address this limitation with $\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling framework that uses a $\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a Test-Time $\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA models without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer (i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of candidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate expansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate actions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted directions, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal action for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can amortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time computational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms available computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the benefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling framework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and an action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient direction-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to enable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce ManiAgent, an agentic architecture for general manipulation tasks that achieves end-to-end output from task descriptions and environmental inputs to robotic manipulation actions. In this framework, multiple agents involve inter-agent communication to perform environmental perception, sub-task decomposition and action generation, enabling efficient handling of complex manipulation scenarios. Evaluations show ManiAgent achieves an 86.8% success rate on the SimplerEnv benchmark and 95.8% on real-world pick-and-place tasks, enabling efficient data collection that yields VLA models with performance comparable to those trained on human-annotated datasets.

This report introduces the latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5, a multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together three major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel architecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn from heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general. Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to "think before acting" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex, multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of physical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can solve complex multi-step tasks.</p></details> |  |

This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to AAAI 2026, currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Representation Regularization for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01711v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |

In this work, we take an initial step toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data. Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, current vision-language-action (VLA) frameworks primarily rely on static representations and limited temporal context, restricting agents to short-horizon, reactive behaviors and hindering robust generalization in dynamic embodied environments. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience theories of episodic memory, we propose, to our knowledge, one of the first formalized episodic world models in VLA, enabling embodied robots to accumulate, recall, and predict sequential experiences. As an instantiation of this concept, our unified TriVLA realizes the episodic world model through a triple-system architecture: integrating multimodal grounding from a pretrained VLM (System 2) and temporally rich dynamics perception from a video diffusion model (System 3). This enables the agent to accumulate and recall sequential experiences, interpret current contexts, and predict future environmental evolution. Guided by episodic representations that span both the past and anticipated future, the downstream policy (System 1) generates coherent, context-aware action sequences through flow-matching and cross-modal attention mechanisms. Experimental results show that TriVLA operates efficiently at approximately 36 Hz and consistently outperforms baseline models on standard benchmarks and challenging real-world manipulation tasks. It demonstrates strong long-horizon planning and open-ended intent understanding, showcasing the advantages of episodic world model-inspired reasoning for robust, generalizable robot intelligence.

| **[TabVLA: Targeted Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10932v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions, potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores the need for more advanced defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 tables, 1 figure.

To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich, diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity. Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities, from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments, and tasks.

In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior after deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of Flow-Matching Policies for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09976v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However, conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency, clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned, diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines, observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.</p></details> |  |

For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at https://goba-attack.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Pruning has enabled efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

However, current SOTA VLAs are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions. Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning, endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEAS: DEtached value learning with Action Sequence for Scalable Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07730v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However, current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://changyeon.site/deas</p></details> |

Existing methods relying on text-only instructions often struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. We argue that interleaved image-text inputs offer richer and less biased context and enable robots to better handle unseen tasks with more versatile human-robot interaction. Building on this insight, Interleave-VLA, the first robot learning paradigm capable of comprehending interleaved image-text instructions and directly generating continuous action sequences in the physical world, is introduced. It offers a natural, flexible, and model-agnostic paradigm that extends state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) models with minimal modifications while achieving strong zero-shot generalization. Interleave-VLA also includes an automatic pipeline that converts text instructions from Open X-Embodiment into interleaved image-text instructions, resulting in a large-scale real-world interleaved embodied dataset with 210k episodes. Comprehensive evaluation in simulation and the real world shows that Interleave-VLA offers two major benefits: (1) improves out-of-domain generalization to unseen objects by 2x compared to text input baselines, (2) supports flexible task interfaces and diverse instructions in a zero-shot manner, such as hand-drawn sketches. We attribute Interleave-VLA's strong zero-shot capability to the use of instruction images, which effectively mitigate hallucinations, and the inclusion of heterogeneous multimodal datasets, enriched with Internet-sourced images, offering potential for scalability.

Recent advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and occluded scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/TrackVLA-plus-plus-Web/</p></details> |

By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks.

| **[Bring the Apple, Not the Sofa: Impact of Irrelevant Context in Embodied AI Commands on VLA Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07067v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models are widely used in Embodied AI, enabling robots to interpret and execute language instructions. However, their robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations. Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |
| **[RLinf-VLA: A Unified and Efficient Framework for VLA+RL Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06710v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in vision and language foundation models has significantly advanced multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation, inspiring a surge of interest in extending such capabilities to embodied settings through vision-language-action (VLA) models. Yet, most VLA models are still trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25 ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report of the RLinf Team, focusing on the algorithm side.

| **[OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining. To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer, which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training convergence and model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowVLA: Visual Chain of Thought-based Motion Reasoning for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18269v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world model trained via next-frame prediction ``$v_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$''. However, this paradigm attempts to predict the future frame's appearance directly, without explicitly reasoning about the underlying dynamics. \textbf{This lack of an explicit motion reasoning step} often leads to physically implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a paradigm that compels the model to first reason about \textbf{motion dynamics} before generating the future frame. We instantiate this paradigm by proposing \textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction that inherently encodes motion. By forcing the model to first follow the motion plan encoded by $f_t$, this process inherently \textbf{aligns the pre-training objective of dynamics prediction with the downstream task of action generation.} We conduct experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations. Our FlowVLA not only generates \textbf{more coherent and physically plausible visual predictions}, but also achieves state-of-the-art policy performance with \textbf{substantially improved sample efficiency}, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.

| **[Verifier-free Test-Time Sampling for Vision Language Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05681v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.</p></details> | 14 pages; 3 figures |
| **[MetaVLA: Unified Meta Co-training For Efficient Embodied Adaption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05580v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning, and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified, backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment. MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead. On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied agents. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperVLA: Efficient Inference in Vision-Language-Action Models via Hypernetworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04898v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Built upon language and vision foundation models with strong generalization ability and trained on large-scale robotic data, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising approach to learning generalist robotic policies. However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely high inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this problem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during both training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based architecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference, while still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse multi-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is nontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that improve its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from existing vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation strategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even higher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation, while significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a state-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters at test time by $90\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\times$.

| **[ContextVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Amortized Multi-Frame Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04246v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging temporal context is crucial for success in partially observable robotic tasks. However, prior work in behavior cloning has demonstrated inconsistent performance gains when using multi-frame observations. In this paper, we introduce ContextVLA, a policy model that robustly improves robotic task performance by effectively leveraging multi-frame observations. Our approach is motivated by the key observation that Vision-Language-Action models (VLA), i.e., policy models built upon a Vision-Language Model (VLM), more effectively utilize multi-frame observations for action generation. This suggests that VLMs' inherent temporal understanding capability enables them to extract more meaningful context from multi-frame observations. However, the high dimensionality of video inputs introduces significant computational overhead, making VLA training and inference inefficient. To address this, ContextVLA compresses past observations into a single context token, allowing the policy to efficiently leverage temporal context for action generation. Our experiments show that ContextVLA consistently improves over single-frame VLAs and achieves the benefits of full multi-frame training but with reduced training and inference times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huiwon-jang.github.io/contextvla</p></details> |
| **[AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/AutoPrune.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[SITCOM: Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04041v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robust robotic control policies remains a major challenge due to the high cost of collecting labeled data, limited generalization to unseen environments, and difficulties in planning over long horizons. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a promising solution by grounding natural language instructions into single-step control commands, they often lack mechanisms for lookahead and struggle with compounding errors in dynamic tasks. In this project, we introduce Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs (SITCOM), a framework that augments any pretrained VLA with model-based rollouts and reward-based trajectory selection, inspired by Model Predictive Control algorithm. SITCOM leverages a learned dynamics model to simulate multi-step action rollouts to select the best candidate plan for real-world execution, transforming one-shot VLAs into robust long-horizon planners. We develop an efficient transformer-based dynamics model trained on large-scale BridgeV2 data and fine-tuned on SIMPLER environments to bridge the Real2Sim gap, and score candidate rollouts using rewards from simulator. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and settings in the SIMPLER environment, we demonstrate that SITCOM when combined with a good reward function can significantly improve task completion rate from 48% to 72% using trained dynamics model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI (SpaVLE). *Equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[Bridge Thinking and Acting: Unleashing Physical Potential of VLM with Generalizable Action Expert](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03896v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture, generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data. While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from "acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible. Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoTVLA: Narrowing of Dense Action Trajectories for Generalizable Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03895v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIBERO-PRO: Towards Robust and Fair Evaluation of Vision-Language-Action Models Beyond Memorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03827v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization and comprehension. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Zxy-MLlab/LIBERO-PRO.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner. Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360 observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/MM-Nav-Web/</p></details> |
| **[SP-VLA: A Joint Model Scheduling and Token Pruning Approach for VLA Model Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12723v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves 1.5$\times$ lossless acceleration in LIBERO and 2.4$\times$ in SimplerEnv, with up to 6% average performance gain. Inference frequency and latency improve by 2.2$\times$ in SimplerEnv and 1.4$\times$ in LIBERO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v5)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOTE: Vision-Language-Action Optimization with Trajectory Ensemble Voting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05116v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However, current VLA models suffer from two drawbacks: (i) generation of massive tokens leading to high inference latency and increased training cost, and (ii) insufficient utilization of generated actions resulting in potential performance loss. To address these issues, we develop a training framework to finetune VLA models for generating significantly fewer action tokens with high parallelism, effectively reducing inference latency and training cost. Furthermore, we introduce an inference optimization technique with a novel voting-based ensemble strategy to combine current and previous action predictions, improving the utilization of generated actions and overall performance. Our results demonstrate that we achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, achieving significantly higher success rates and 39$\times$ faster inference than OpenVLA with 46 Hz throughput on edge platforms, demonstrating practical deployability.

| **[HAMLET: Switch your Vision-Language-Action Model into a History-Aware Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00695v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context. In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of 76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from 64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://myungkyukoo.github.io/hamlet/</p></details> |
| **[FailSafe: Reasoning and Recovery from Failures in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01642v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to release the FailSafe code to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jimntu.github.io/FailSafe/</p></details> |
| **[VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01623v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods.

We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned, offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human intervention.</p></details> |  |

Improving Diffusion-based or Flow-based Robot Policies via Test-time Distribution-level Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01068v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sagecao1125.github.io/GPC-Site/</p></details> |

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA.

Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions. However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUI-R1 : A Generalist R1-Style Vision-Language Action Model For GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10458v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator. Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the generalization and robustness of VLA models.

Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

We present VAR-SLAM (Visual Adaptive and Robust SLAM), an ORB-SLAM3-based system that combines a lightweight semantic keypoint filter to deal with known moving objects, with Barron's adaptive robust loss to handle unknown ones. The shape parameter of the robust kernel is estimated online from residuals, allowing the system to automatically adjust between Gaussian and heavy-tailed behavior. We evaluate VAR-SLAM on the TUM RGB-D, Bonn RGB-D Dynamic, and OpenLORIS datasets, which include both known and unknown moving objects. Results show improved trajectory accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 25% lower ATE RMSE than NGD-SLAM on challenging sequences, while maintaining performance at 27 FPS on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/VAR-SLAM</p></details> |

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general, and feature detection and SLAM in particular. On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal). The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM. However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in 2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

While several influential datasets have driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR, multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized multimodal data and ground truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility. The project's documentation, including source code, CAD models, and dataset links, is publicly available at https://snt-arg.github.io/smapper_docs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose EgoExo, a geometry-driven solution integrated into a visual SLAM pipeline that synthesizes on-demand exocentric (third-person) views from egocentric camera feeds. Our proposed framework, EgoExo++, extends beyond 2D exocentric view synthesis (EgoExo) to augment a dense 2.5D ground surface estimation on-the-fly. It simultaneously renders the ROV model onto this reconstructed surface, enhancing semantic perception and depth comprehension. The computations involved are closed-form and rely solely on egocentric views and monocular SLAM estimates, which makes it portable across existing teleoperation engines and robust to varying waterbody characteristics. We validate the geometric accuracy of our approach through extensive experiments of 2-DOF indoor navigation and 6-DOF underwater cave exploration in challenging low-light conditions. Quantitative metrics confirm the reliability of the rendered Exo views, while a user study involving 15 operators demonstrates improved situational awareness, navigation safety, and task efficiency during teleoperation. Furthermore, we highlight the role of EgoExo++ augmented visuals in supporting shared autonomy, operator training, and embodied teleoperation. This new interactive approach to ROV teleoperation presents promising opportunities for future research in subsea telerobotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>EgoEx...</summary><p>EgoExo++ (Journal extension), V5, metadata updated, 12 pages</p></details> |

LiDAR-based SLAM achieves high geometric precision, but its sensors are typically large and power-demanding, limiting their use on portable platforms. Visual SLAM offers a practical alternative with lightweight cameras already embedded in most mobile devices. however, visually mapping construction environments remains challenging: repetitive layouts, occlusions, and incomplete or low-texture structures often cause drift in the trajectory map. To mitigate this, we propose an RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates the Building Information Model (BIM) as structural prior knowledge. Instead of relying solely on visual cues, our system continuously establishes correspondences between detected wall and their BIM counterparts, which are then introduced as constraints in the back-end optimization. The proposed method operates in real time and has been validated on real construction sites, reducing trajectory error by an average of 23.71% and map RMSE by 7.14% compared to visual SLAM baselines. These results demonstrate that BIM constraints enable reliable alignment of the digital plan with the as-built scene, even under partially constructed conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

Many of the available visual SLAM methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, all while operating in near real-time.

In this work, we present Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes, without calibrated cameras or depth sensors. Our method begins with geometric recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint. To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to in-the-wild videos, showcasing its generalizability.

Since the first foundational work in Semantic SLAM appeared more than two decades ago, this field has received increasing attention across various scientific communities. Despite its significance, the field lacks comprehensive surveys encompassing recent advances and persistent challenges. In response, this study provides a thorough examination of the state-of-the-art of Semantic SLAM techniques, with the aim of illuminating current trends and key obstacles. Beginning with an in-depth exploration of the evolution of visual SLAM, this study outlines its strengths and unique characteristics, while also critically assessing previous survey literature. Subsequently, a unified problem formulation and evaluation of the modular solution framework is proposed, which divides the problem into discrete stages, including visual localization, semantic feature extraction, mapping, data association, and loop closure optimization. Moreover, this study investigates alternative methodologies such as deep learning and the utilization of large language models, alongside a review of relevant research about contemporary SLAM datasets.

Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods only use image pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps, apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> |  |

However, robots are typically equipped with sensors that provide some form of dead reckoning odometry with reasonable short-time performance but unreliable long-time performance. The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides a framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual SLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it describes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to incorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when visual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is strong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields a practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM performance and robustness. Experiments on collected datasets and in real-world deployment demonstrate the benefits of Good Weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

This is partly due to the lack of controlled, ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges, such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes, using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance. Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks, including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of our system for two underwater vision tasks.

Addressing geometric inaccuracies in existing RGB-only 3DGS SLAM methods that stem from unreliable depth estimation, ConfidentSplat incorporates a core innovation: a confidence-weighted fusion mechanism. This mechanism adaptively integrates depth cues from multiview geometry with learned monocular priors (Omnidata ViT), dynamically weighting their contributions based on explicit reliability estimates-derived predominantly from multi-view geometric consistency-to generate high-fidelity proxy depth for map supervision. The resulting proxy depth guides the optimization of a deformable 3DGS map, which efficiently adapts online to maintain global consistency following pose updates from a DROID-SLAM-inspired frontend and backend optimizations (loop closure, global bundle adjustment).

While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, realising scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We present a novel LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by constraining the radiance field with the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction. We also provide an open-source implementation of PING at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PINGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, presented at RSS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel active illumination framework to enhance the performance of VO and V-SLAM algorithms in these challenging conditions. The developed approach dynamically controls a moving light source to illuminate highly textured areas, thereby improving feature extraction and tracking. Specifically, a detector block, which incorporates a deep learning-based enhancing network, identifies regions with relevant features. Then, a pan-tilt controller is responsible for guiding the light beam toward these areas, so that to provide information-rich images to the ego-motion estimation algorithm. Experimental results on a real robotic platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the pose estimation error up to 75% with respect to a traditional fixed lighting technique.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

This limitation reduces reliability in applications such as visual SLAM, precise 3D modeling, and view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) overcomes this challenge by producing depth maps with absolute scale, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling deployment without additional calibration. This survey reviews the evolution of MMDE, from geometry-based methods to state-of-the-art deep models, with emphasis on the datasets that drive progress. Key benchmarks, including KITTI, NYU-D, ApolloScape, and TartanAir, are examined in terms of modality, scene type, and application domain. Methodological advances are analyzed, covering domain generalization, boundary preservation, and the integration of synthetic and real data. Techniques such as unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, patch-based inference, architectural innovations, and generative modeling are evaluated for their strengths and limitations. By synthesizing current progress, highlighting the importance of high-quality datasets, and identifying open challenges, this survey provides a structured reference for advancing MMDE and supporting its adoption in real-world computer vision systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam (DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and communication.

Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

However, these algorithms are application-specific and do not work across applications with different types of motion; even a tracking algorithm designed for a given application does not work in scenarios deviating from highly standard conditions. For example, a tracking algorithm designed for robot navigation inside a building will not work for tracking the same robot in an outdoor environment. To demonstrate this problem, we evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art tracking methods across various applications and scenarios. To inform our analysis, we first categorize algorithmic, environmental, and locomotion-related challenges faced by tracking algorithms. We quantitatively evaluate the performance using multiple tracking algorithms and representative datasets for a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) and Extended Reality (XR) applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and humans. Our analysis shows that no tracking algorithm works across different applications and scenarios within applications. Ultimately, using the insights generated from our analysis, we discuss multiple approaches to improving the tracking performance using input data characterization, leveraging intermediate information, and output evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore, we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Our FLAF-based visual navigation is built upon a feature-based visual teach and repeat (VT\&R) framework, which supports many robotic applications by teaching a robot to navigate on various paths that cover a significant portion of daily autonomous navigation requirements. However, tracking failure in feature-based visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) caused by textureless regions in human-made environments is still limiting VT\&R to be adopted in the real world. To address this problem, the proposed view planner is integrated into a feature-based visual SLAM system to build up an active VT\&R system that avoids tracking failure. In our system, a pan-tilt unit (PTU)-based active camera is mounted on the mobile robot. Using FLAF, the active camera-based VSLAM operates during the teaching phase to construct a complete path map and in the repeat phase to maintain stable localization. FLAF orients the robot toward more map points to avoid mapping failures during path learning and toward more feature-identifiable map points beneficial for localization while following the learned trajectory. Experiments in real scenarios demonstrate that FLAF outperforms the methods that do not consider feature-identifiability, and our active VT\&R system performs well in complex environments by effectively dealing with low-texture regions.</p></details> |  |

Existing feature-based SLAM systems rely on fixed front-end parameters, making them vulnerable to sudden lighting changes and unstable feature tracking. To address these challenges, we propose ``IRAF-SLAM'', an Illumination-Robust and Adaptive Feature-Culling front-end designed to enhance vSLAM resilience in complex and challenging environments. Our approach introduces: (1) an image enhancement scheme to preprocess and adjust image quality under varying lighting conditions; (2) an adaptive feature extraction mechanism that dynamically adjusts detection sensitivity based on image entropy, pixel intensity, and gradient analysis; and (3) a feature culling strategy that filters out unreliable feature points using density distribution analysis and a lighting impact factor. Comprehensive evaluations on the TUM-VI and European Robotics Challenge (EuRoC) datasets demonstrate that IRAF-SLAM significantly reduces tracking failures and achieves superior trajectory accuracy compared to state-of-the-art vSLAM methods under adverse illumination conditions. These results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive front-end strategies in improving vSLAM robustness without incurring significant computational overhead.

However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation. These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms originally developed for structured urban environments. To address this gap, we present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial configurations. We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with monocular, stereo, and RGBD cameras, as well as inertial sensors. It covers 39 recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without external lighting. With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse challenging conditions. The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and RGBD configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn. Our analysis highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency. This dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in real-world, semi-structured environments, fostering the development of more resilient SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping.

In unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), most research emphasizes visual SLAM, sensor fusion, and path planning. However, applying UAVs to search and rescue missions in disaster zones remains underexplored, especially for autonomous navigation. This report develops methods for real-time and secure UAV maneuvering in complex 3D environments, crucial during forest fires. Building upon past research, it focuses on designing navigation algorithms for unfamiliar and hazardous environments, aiming to improve rescue efficiency and safety through UAV-based early warning and rapid response. The work unfolds in phases. First, a 2D fusion navigation strategy is explored, initially for mobile robots, enabling safe movement in dynamic settings. This sets the stage for advanced features such as adaptive obstacle handling and decision-making enhancements. Next, a novel 3D reactive navigation strategy is introduced for collision-free movement in forest fire simulations, addressing the unique challenges of UAV operations in such scenarios. Finally, the report proposes a unified control approach that integrates UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for coordinated rescue missions in forest environments. Each phase presents challenges, proposes control models, and validates them with mathematical and simulation-based evidence.

However, these methods incur significant computational overhead as the camera tracking needs to wait for the deep neural network to generate mask at each frame, and they typically require GPUs for real-time operation, which restricts their practicality in real-world robotic applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time dynamic SLAM system that runs exclusively on a CPU. Our approach incorporates a mask propagation mechanism that decouples camera tracking and deep learning-based masking for each frame. We also introduce a hybrid tracking strategy that integrates ORB features with optical flow methods, enhancing both robustness and efficiency by selectively allocating computational resources to input frames. Compared to previous methods, our system maintains high localization accuracy in dynamic environments while achieving a tracking frame rate of 60 FPS on a laptop CPU. These results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing deep learning for dynamic SLAM without GPU support.

Recent advancements in underwater visual SLAM systems for aquatic environments have garnered significant attention in marine robotics research. However, existing underwater visual SLAM datasets often lack groundtruth trajectory data, making it difficult to objectively compare the performance of different SLAM algorithms based solely on qualitative results or COLMAP reconstruction. In this paper, we present a novel underwater dataset that includes ground truth trajectory data obtained using a motion capture system. Additionally, for the first time, we release visual data that includes both events and frames for benchmarking underwater visual positioning. By providing event camera data, we aim to facilitate the development of more robust and advanced underwater visual SLAM algorithms. The use of event cameras can help mitigate challenges posed by extremely low light or hazy underwater conditions.

| **[PLGSLAM: Progressive Neural Scene Represenation with Local to Global Bundle Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09866v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown encouraging results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we introduce PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system capable of high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real-time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation, PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature, achieving smoothness and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments).

However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods are all constrained to small-room scenarios and struggle with memory explosion in large-scale scenes and long sequences. To this end, we propose VPGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-based large-scale RGBD SLAM framework for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. We design a novel voxel-based progressive 3D Gaussian mapping method with multiple submaps for compact and accurate scene representation in large-scale and long-sequence scenes. This allows us to scale up to arbitrary scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In addition, we propose a 2D-3D fusion camera tracking method to achieve robust and accurate camera tracking in both indoor and outdoor large-scale scenes. Furthermore, we design a 2D-3D Gaussian loop closure method to eliminate pose drift. We further propose a submap fusion method with online distillation to achieve global consistency in large-scale scenes when detecting a loop. Experiments on various indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the proposed framework. The code will be open source on https://github.com/dtc111111/vpgs-slam.</p></details> |  |

| **[Is Semantic SLAM Ready for Embedded Systems ? A Comparative Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12384v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embedded systems, robots must perceive and interpret their environment efficiently to operate reliably in real-world conditions. Visual Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enhances standard SLAM by incorporating semantic information into the map, enabling more informed decision-making. However, implementing such systems on resource-limited hardware involves trade-offs between accuracy, computing efficiency, and power usage. This paper provides a comparative review of recent Semantic Visual SLAM methods with a focus on their applicability to embedded platforms. We analyze three main types of architectures - Geometric SLAM, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and 3D Gaussian Splatting - and evaluate their performance on constrained hardware, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. We compare their accuracy, segmentation quality, memory usage, and energy consumption. Our results show that methods based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting achieve high semantic detail but demand substantial computing resources, limiting their use on embedded devices. In contrast, Semantic Geometric SLAM offers a more practical balance between computational cost and accuracy. The review highlights a need for SLAM algorithms that are better adapted to embedded environments, and it discusses key directions for improving their efficiency through algorithm-hardware co-design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Gaussian Splatting SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09915v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM. However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even traditional approaches.

However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix the overview figure</p></details> |

| **[GroundSLAM: A Robust Visual SLAM System for Warehouse Robots Using Ground Textures](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05502v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A robust visual localization and mapping system is essential for warehouse robot navigation, as cameras offer a more cost-effective alternative to LiDAR sensors. However, existing forward-facing camera systems often encounter challenges in dynamic environments and open spaces, leading to significant performance degradation during deployment. To address these limitations, a localization system utilizing a single downward-facing camera to capture ground textures presents a promising solution. Nevertheless, existing feature-based ground-texture localization methods face difficulties when operating on surfaces with sparse features or repetitive patterns. To address this limitation, we propose GroundSLAM, a novel feature-free and ground-texture-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. GroundSLAM consists of three components: feature-free visual odometry, ground-texture-based loop detection and map optimization, and map reuse. Specifically, we introduce a kernel cross-correlator (KCC) for image-level pose tracking, loop detection, and map reuse to improve localization accuracy and robustness, and incorporate adaptive pruning strategies to enhance efficiency. Due to these specific designs, GroundSLAM is able to deliver efficient and stable localization across various ground surfaces such as those with sparse features and repetitive patterns. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first ground-texture dataset with precise ground-truth poses, consisting of 131k images collected from 10 kinds of indoor and outdoor ground surfaces. Extensive experimental results show that GroundSLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both indoor and outdoor localization. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/sair-lab/GroundSLAM.</p></details> |  |

| **[MCVO: A Generic Visual Odometry for Arbitrarily Arranged Multi-Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03146v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making multi-camera visual SLAM systems easier to set up and more robust to the environment is attractive for vision robots. Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow sensing Field-of-View (FoV), resulting in degenerated accuracy and limited robustness in textureless environments. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy with much wider FoV. However, the usual arbitrary placement and orientation of multiple cameras make the pose scale estimation and system updating challenging. To address these problems, we propose a robust visual odometry system for rigidly-bundled arbitrarily-arranged multi-cameras, namely MCVO, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams to GPU. Then we initialize the odometry system with the metric-scale poses under the rigid constraints between moving cameras. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate its robustness over arbitrarily arranged cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose accuracy with better generalization ability. Our codes and online demos are available at https://github.com/JunhaoWang615/MCVO</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Loop Closure from Two Views: Revisiting PGO for Scalable Trajectory Estimation through Monocular Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(Visual) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a fundamental challenge in enabling autonomous systems to navigate and understand large-scale environments. Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details> |  |

Our key innovation consists of augmenting the standard neural representation by a normalizing flow network. As a result, achieving strong representation power on the specific class of road vehicles is made possible by compact networks with only 16-dimensional latent codes. Furthermore, the newly proposed architecture exhibits a significant performance improvement in the presence of only sparse and noisy data, which is demonstrated through comparative experiments on synthetic data. The module is embedded into the back-end of a stereo-vision based framework for joint, incremental shape optimization. The loss function is given by a combination of a sparse 3D point-based SDF loss, a sparse rendering loss, and a semantic mask-based silhouette-consistency term. We furthermore leverage semantic information to determine keypoint extraction density in the front-end. Finally, experimental results on real-world data reveal accurate and reliable performance comparable to alternative frameworks that make use of direct depth readings. The proposed method performs well with only sparse 3D points obtained from bundle adjustment, and eventually continues to deliver stable results even under exclusive use of the mask-consistency term.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, IROS 2024</p></details> |

To address the critical challenge of achieving reliable localization in low-texture environments, where traditional point-based systems often fail due to insufficient visual features, we introduce a novel approach leveraging Global Primitives structural information to improve the system's robustness and accuracy performance. Our key innovation lies in constructing vanishing points from line features and proposing a weighted fusion strategy to build Global Primitives in the world coordinate system. This strategy associates multiple frames with non-overlapping regions and formulates a multi-frame reprojection error optimization, significantly improving tracking accuracy in texture-scarce scenarios. Evaluations on various datasets show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory precision, particularly in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |

Owing to their original use-case, such systems often only contain a single camera facing into either direction and very limited overlap between fields of view. Our novelty consist of three optimization modules targeting at practical online calibration of exterior orientations from simple two-view geometry, reliable front-end initialization of relative displacements, and accurate back-end optimization using a continuous-time trajectory model. The commonality between the proposed modules is given by the fact that all three of them exploit motion priors that are related to the inherent non-holonomic characteristics of passenger vehicle motion. In contrast to prior related art, the proposed modules furthermore excel in terms of bypassing partial unobservabilities in the transformation variables that commonly occur for Ackermann-motion. As a further contribution, the modules are built into a novel surround-view camera SLAM system that specifically targets deployment on Ackermann vehicles operating in urban environments. All modules are studied in the context of in-depth ablation studies, and the practical validity of the entire framework is supported by a successful application to challenging, large-scale publicly available online datasets. Note that upon acceptance, the entire framework is scheduled for open-source release as part of an extension of the OpenGV library.</p></details> |  |

However, regardless of the implementation domain, visual SLAM's performance is subject to diverse environmental challenges, such as dynamic elements in outdoor environments, harsh imaging conditions in underwater environments, or blurriness in high-speed setups. These environmental challenges need to be identified to study the real-world viability of SLAM implementations. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, this paper surveys the current state of visual SLAM algorithms according to the two main frameworks: geometry-based and learning-based SLAM. First, we introduce a general formulation of the SLAM pipeline that includes most of the implementations in the literature. Second, those implementations are classified and surveyed for geometry and learning-based SLAM. After that, environment-specific challenges are formulated to enable experimental evaluation of the resilience of different visual SLAM classes to varying imaging conditions. We address two significant issues in surveying visual SLAM, providing (1) a consistent classification of visual SLAM pipelines and (2) a robust evaluation of their performance under different deployment conditions. Finally, we give our take on future opportunities for visual SLAM implementations.</p></details> |  |

While incorporating semantic scene knowledge aids in building richer maps with contextual associations among mapped objects, representing them in structured formats like scene graphs has not been widely addressed, encountering complex map comprehension and limited scalability. This paper introduces visual S-Graphs (vS-Graphs), a novel real-time VSLAM framework that integrates vision-based scene understanding with map reconstruction and comprehensible graph-based representation. The framework infers structural elements (i.e., rooms and corridors) from detected building components (i.e., walls and ground surfaces) and incorporates them into optimizable 3D scene graphs. This solution enhances the reconstructed map's semantic richness, comprehensibility, and localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that vS-Graphs outperforms state-of-the-art VSLAM methods, reducing trajectory error by an average of 3.38% and up to 9.58% on real-world data. Furthermore, the proposed framework achieves environment-driven semantic entity detection accuracy comparable to precise LiDAR-based frameworks using only visual features.

Under the hood, however, DUSt3R processes image pairs, regressing local 3D reconstructions that need to be aligned in a global coordinate system. The number of pairs, growing quadratically, is an inherent limitation that becomes especially concerning for robust and fast optimization in the case of large image collections. In this paper, we propose an extension of DUSt3R from pairs to multiple views, that addresses all aforementioned concerns. Indeed, we propose a Multi-view Network for Stereo 3D Reconstruction, or MUSt3R, that modifies the DUSt3R architecture by making it symmetric and extending it to directly predict 3D structure for all views in a common coordinate frame. Second, we entail the model with a multi-layer memory mechanism which allows to reduce the computational complexity and to scale the reconstruction to large collections, inferring thousands of 3D pointmaps at high frame-rates with limited added complexity. The framework is designed to perform 3D reconstruction both offline and online, and hence can be seamlessly applied to SfM and visual SLAM scenarios showing state-of-the-art performance on various 3D downstream tasks, including uncalibrated Visual Odometry, relative camera pose, scale and focal estimation, 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While planning with multiple robots, each robot maintains a belief over the state of the environment and reasons how the belief would evolve in the future for different possible actions. However, existing MR-BSP works have a common assumption that the beliefs of different robots are same at planning time. Such an assumption is often unrealistic as it requires prohibitively extensive and frequent data sharing capabilities. In practice, robots may have limited communication capabilities, and consequently beliefs of the robots can be different. Crucially, when the robots have inconsistent beliefs, the existing approaches could result in lack of coordination between the robots and may lead to unsafe decisions. In this paper, we present decentralized MR-BSP algorithms, with performance guarantees, for tackling this crucial gap. Our algorithms leverage the notion of action preferences. The base algorithm VerifyAC guarantees a consistent joint action selection by the cooperative robots via a three-step verification. When the verification succeeds, VerifyAC finds a consistent joint action without triggering a communication; otherwise it triggers a communication. We design an extended algorithm R-VerifyAC for further reducing the number of communications, by relaxing the criteria of action consistency. Another extension R-VerifyAC-simp builds on verifying a partial set of observations and improves the computation time significantly. The theoretical performance guarantees are corroborated with simulation results in discrete setting. Furthermore, we formulate our approaches for continuous and high-dimensional state and observation spaces, and provide experimental results for active multi-robot visual SLAM with real robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>The n...</summary><p>The new version has been extended from the existing arxiv version of the paper in the following way: - The old (base) algorithm VerifyAC has been retained in the new version. - Added two new algorithms R-VerifyAC and R-VerifyAC-simp along with their performance guarantees. - A new formulation in continuous spaces have been added. - Experimental results for the new approaches have been added</p></details> |

In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  |

However, thermal imaging faces challenges like low contrast, high noise, and limited large-scale annotated datasets, restricting the use of deep learning in outdoor scenarios. We present DarkSLAM, a noval deep learning-based monocular thermal SLAM system designed for large-scale localization and reconstruction in complex lighting conditions.Our approach incorporates the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism in visual odometry and the Selective Kernel Attention (SKA) mechanism in depth estimation to enhance pose accuracy and mitigate thermal depth degradation. Additionally, the system includes thermal depth-based loop closure detection and pose optimization, ensuring robust performance in low-texture thermal scenes. Extensive outdoor experiments demonstrate that DarkSLAM significantly outperforms existing methods like SC-Sfm-Learner and Shin et al., delivering precise localization and 3D dense mapping even in challenging nighttime environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches encounter challenges, including sensitivity to artifacts and noise, suboptimal selection of training viewpoints, and the absence of global optimization. In this paper, we propose GSORB-SLAM, a dense SLAM framework that integrates 3DGS with ORB features through a tightly coupled optimization pipeline. To mitigate the effects of noise and artifacts, we propose a novel geometric representation and optimization method for tracking, which significantly enhances localization accuracy and robustness. For high-fidelity mapping, we develop an adaptive Gaussian expansion and regularization method that facilitates compact yet expressive scene modeling while suppressing redundant primitives. Furthermore, we design a hybrid graph-based viewpoint selection mechanism that effectively reduces overfitting and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tracking precision-improving RMSE by 16.2% compared to ORB-SLAM2 baselines-and reconstruction quality-improving PSNR by 3.93 dB compared to 3DGS-SLAM baselines.

Despite the strong progress in this field, there are still challenging situations in which established methods fail. We present an approach to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of established visual localization methods by adding rendered images. In detail, we first use a modern visual SLAM approach that provides a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based map to create reference data. We demonstrate that enriching reference data with images rendered from 3DGS at randomly sampled poses significantly improves the performance of both geometry-based visual localization and Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods. Through comprehensive evaluation in a large industrial environment, we analyze the performance impact of incorporating these additional rendered views.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches require careful manual tuning and incur substantial computational overhead, while learning-based methods either lack explicit loop closure capabilities or implement them through computationally expensive methods. We present AutoLoop, a novel approach that combines automated curriculum learning with efficient fine-tuning for visual SLAM systems. Our method employs a DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) agent to dynamically adjust loop closure weights during training, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter search while significantly reducing the required training steps. The approach pre-computes potential loop closure pairs offline and leverages them through an agent-guided curriculum, allowing the model to adapt efficiently to new scenarios. Experiments conducted on TartanAir for training and validated across multiple benchmarks including KITTI, EuRoC, ICL-NUIM and TUM RGB-D demonstrate that AutoLoop achieves comparable or superior performance while reducing training time by an order of magnitude compared to traditional approaches. AutoLoop provides a practical solution for rapid adaptation of visual SLAM systems, automating the weight tuning process that traditionally requires multiple manual iterations. Our results show that this automated curriculum strategy not only accelerates training but also maintains or improves the model's performance across diverse environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a prominent solution to this problem. SLAM is a framework that consists of a diverse set of computational tasks ranging from real-time tracking to computation-intensive map optimization. This combination can present a challenge for resource-limited mobile robots. Previously, edge-assisted SLAM methods have demonstrated promising real-time execution capabilities by offloading heavy computations while performing real-time tracking onboard. However, the common approach of utilizing a client-server architecture for offloading is sensitive to server and network failures. In this article, we propose a novel edge-assisted SLAM framework capable of self-organizing fully distributed SLAM execution across a network of devices or functioning on a single device without connectivity. The architecture consists of three layers and is designed to be device-agnostic, resilient to network failures, and minimally invasive to the core SLAM system. We have implemented and demonstrated the framework for monocular ORB SLAM3 and evaluated it in both fully distributed and standalone SLAM configurations against the ORB SLAM3. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed design matches the accuracy and resource utilization of the monolithic approach while enabling collaborative execution.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3 with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches for SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024.

| **[Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08496v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

Most conventional structure from motion and monocular SLAM techniques assume input videos that feature predominantly static scenes with large amounts of parallax. Such methods tend to produce erroneous estimates in the absence of these conditions. Recent neural network-based approaches attempt to overcome these challenges; however, such methods are either computationally expensive or brittle when run on dynamic videos with uncontrolled camera motion or unknown field of view. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of a deep visual SLAM framework: with careful modifications to its training and inference schemes, this system can scale to real-world videos of complex dynamic scenes with unconstrained camera paths, including videos with little camera parallax. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos demonstrate that our system is significantly more accurate and robust at camera pose and depth estimation when compared with prior and concurrent work, with faster or comparable running times.

Ground-Truth-Free Tuning of Structure from Motion and Visual SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01116v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation is critical to both developing and tuning Structure from Motion (SfM) and Visual SLAM (VSLAM) systems, but is universally reliant on high-quality geometric ground truth -- a resource that is not only costly and time-intensive but, in many cases, entirely unobtainable. This dependency on ground truth restricts SfM and SLAM applications across diverse environments and limits scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel ground-truth-free (GTF) evaluation methodology that eliminates the need for geometric ground truth, instead using sensitivity estimation via sampling from both original and noisy versions of input images. Our approach shows strong correlation with traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks and supports GTF hyperparameter tuning. Removing the need for ground truth opens up new opportunities to leverage a much larger number of dataset sources, and for self-supervised and online tuning, with the potential for a data-driven breakthrough analogous to what has occurred in generative AI.</p></details> |  |

However, reconstructing thin structures of indoor scenes while ensuring real-time performance remains a challenge for dense visual SLAM systems. Previous methods do not consider varying quality of input RGB-D data and employ fixed-frequency mapping process to reconstruct the scene, which could result in the loss of valuable information in some frames. In this paper, we propose Uni-SLAM, a decoupled 3D spatial representation based on hash grids for indoor reconstruction. We introduce a novel defined predictive uncertainty to reweight the loss function, along with strategic local-to-global bundle adjustment. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. It significantly improves over current methods with a 25% reduction in depth L1 error and a 66.86% completion rate within 1 cm on the Replica dataset, reflecting a more accurate reconstruction of thin structures.

It incorporates appearance, geometry, and semantic features through multi-channel optimization, addressing the oversmoothing limitations of neural implicit SLAM systems in high-quality rendering, scene understanding, and object-level geometry. We introduce a unique semantic feature loss that effectively compensates for the shortcomings of traditional depth and color losses in object optimization. Through a semantic-guided keyframe selection strategy, we prevent erroneous reconstructions caused by cumulative errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGS-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, precise semantic segmentation, and object-level geometric accuracy, while ensuring real-time rendering capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Notably, LiV-GS is the first method that directly aligns discrete and sparse LiDAR data with continuous differentiable Gaussian maps in large-scale outdoor scenes, overcoming the limitation of fixed resolution in traditional LiDAR mapping. The system aligns point clouds with Gaussian maps using shared covariance attributes for front-end tracking and integrates the normal orientation into the loss function to refines the Gaussian map. To reliably and stably update Gaussians outside the LiDAR field of view, we introduce a novel conditional Gaussian constraint that aligns these Gaussians closely with the nearest reliable ones. The targeted adjustment enables LiV-GS to achieve fast and accurate mapping with novel view synthesis at a rate of 7.98 FPS. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate LiV-GS's superior performance in SLAM, image rendering and mapping. The successful cross-modal radar-LiDAR localization highlights the potential of LiV-GS for applications in cross-modal semantic positioning and object segmentation with Gaussian maps.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements integrating Gaussian Splatting into SLAM systems have proven effective in creating high-quality renderings using explicit 3D Gaussian models, significantly improving environmental reconstruction fidelity. However, these approaches depend on a static environment assumption and face challenges in dynamic environments due to inconsistent observations of geometry and photometry. To address this problem, we propose DG-SLAM, the first robust dynamic visual SLAM system grounded in 3D Gaussians, which provides precise camera pose estimation alongside high-fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we propose effective strategies, including motion mask generation, adaptive Gaussian point management, and a hybrid camera tracking algorithm to improve the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DG-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis in dynamic scenes, outperforming existing methods meanwhile preserving real-time rendering ability.</p></details> |  |

However, generating these maps in complex environments, such as multi-level parking garages or shopping malls, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a participatory sensing approach that delegates map-building tasks to map users, thereby enabling cost-effective and continuous data collection. The proposed method harnesses the collective efforts of users, facilitating the expansion and ongoing update of the maps as the environment evolves. We realized this approach by developing Map++, an efficient system that functions as a plug-and-play extension, supporting participatory map-building based on existing SLAM algorithms. Map++ addresses a plethora of scalability issues in this participatory map-building system by proposing a set of lightweight, application-layer protocols. We evaluated Map++ in four representative settings: an indoor garage, an outdoor plaza, a public SLAM benchmark, and a simulated environment. The results demonstrate that Map++ can reduce traffic volume by approximately 46% with negligible degradation in mapping accuracy, i.e., less than 0.03m compared to the baseline system. It can support approximately $2 \times$ as many concurrent users as the baseline under the same network bandwidth. Additionally, for users who travel on already-mapped trajectories, they can directly utilize the existing maps for localization and save 47% of the CPU usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures.

While Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (MVSLAM) has emerged as a promising solution, its implementation in endoscopic procedures faces significant challenges due to hardware limitations, such as the use of a monocular camera and the absence of odometry sensors. This study presents BodySLAM, a robust deep learning-based MVSLAM approach that addresses these challenges through three key components: CycleVO, a novel unsupervised monocular pose estimation module; the integration of the state-of-the-art Zoe architecture for monocular depth estimation; and a 3D reconstruction module creating a coherent surgical map. The approach is rigorously evaluated using three publicly available datasets (Hamlyn, EndoSLAM, and SCARED) spanning laparoscopy, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy scenarios, and benchmarked against four state-of-the-art methods. Results demonstrate that CycleVO exhibited competitive performance with the lowest inference time among pose estimation methods, while maintaining robust generalization capabilities, whereas Zoe significantly outperformed existing algorithms for depth estimation in endoscopy. BodySLAM's strong performance across diverse endoscopic scenarios demonstrates its potential as a viable MVSLAM solution for endoscopic applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

In general, they heavily rely on global visual similarity matching. However, the ambiguous similarity interference in uncertain regions could often lead to excessive noise in correspondences, ultimately misleading SLAM in geometric modeling. To address this issue, we propose a Learnable Gaussian Uncertainty (LGU) matching. It mainly focuses on precise correspondence construction. In our scheme, a learnable 2D Gaussian uncertainty model is designed to associate matching-frame pairs. It could generate input-dependent Gaussian distributions for each correspondence map. Additionally, a multi-scale deformable correlation sampling strategy is devised to adaptively fine-tune the sampling of each direction by a priori look-up ranges, enabling reliable correlation construction. Furthermore, a KAN-bias GRU component is adopted to improve a temporal iterative enhancement for accomplishing sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling with limited parameters. The extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

While VSLAM research has achieved significant advancements, its robustness under challenging situations, such as poor lighting, dynamic environments, motion blur, and sensor failures, remains a challenging issue. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel RGB-D dataset designed for evaluating the robustness of VSLAM systems. The dataset comprises real-world indoor scenes with dynamic objects, motion blur, and varying illumination, as well as emulated camera failures, including lens dirt, condensation, underexposure, and overexposure. Additionally, we offer open-source scripts for injecting camera failures into any images, enabling further customization by the research community. Our experiments demonstrate that ORB-SLAM2, a traditional VSLAM algorithm, and TartanVO, a Deep Learning-based VO algorithm, can experience performance degradation under these challenging conditions.

Of the various thermal comfort indicators, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common measurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation techniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional MRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it employs visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface temperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new object detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct temperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal features not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but also provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in the indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the reference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and more efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods. It can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT measurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling and heating systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop</p></details> |

To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

While recent progress on SLAM has been swift, academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors. We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale. This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at https://www.lamaria.ethz.ch.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, tightly-coupled Acoustic-Visual-Inertial SLAM approach, termed AQUA-SLAM, to fuse a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), a stereo camera, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) within a graph optimization framework. Moreover, we propose an efficient sensor calibration technique, encompassing multi-sensor extrinsic calibration (among the DVL, camera and IMU) and DVL transducer misalignment calibration, with a fast linear approximation procedure for real-time online execution. The proposed methods are extensively evaluated in a tank environment with ground truth, and validated for offshore applications in the North Sea. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art underwater and visual-inertial SLAM systems in terms of localization accuracy and robustness.

These environments pose significant challenges due to variable lighting, weather conditions, and complex terrain. Visual-Inertial SLAM has emerged as a promising solution for robust localization under such conditions. This paper benchmarks several open-source Visual-Inertial SLAM systems, including traditional methods (ORB-SLAM3, VINS-Fusion, OpenVINS, Kimera, and SVO Pro) and learning-based approaches (HFNet-SLAM, AirSLAM), to evaluate their performance in unstructured natural outdoor settings. We focus on the impact of loop closing on localization accuracy and computational demands, providing a comprehensive analysis of these systems' effectiveness in real-world environments and especially their application to embedded systems in outdoor robotics. Our contributions further include an assessment of varying frame rates on localization accuracy and computational load. The findings highlight the importance of loop closing in improving localization accuracy while managing computational resources efficiently, offering valuable insights for optimizing Visual-Inertial SLAM systems for practical outdoor applications in mobile robotics.

Hereby depth predictions from a deep neural network are fused in a fully probabilistic manner. Specifically, our method is rigorously uncertainty-aware: first, we use depth and uncertainty predictions from a deep network not only from the robot's stereo rig, but we further probabilistically fuse motion stereo that provides depth information across a range of baselines, therefore drastically increasing mapping accuracy. Next, predicted and fused depth uncertainty propagates not only into occupancy probabilities but also into alignment factors between generated dense submaps that enter the probabilistic nonlinear least squares estimator. This submap representation offers globally consistent geometry at scale. Our method is thoroughly evaluated in two benchmark datasets, resulting in localization and mapping accuracy that exceeds the state of the art, while simultaneously offering volumetric occupancy directly usable for downstream robotic planning and control in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, accepted in ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Safe navigation is crucial for all robotics applications and requires accurate and consistent maps of the robot's surroundings. To achieve full autonomy and allow deployment in a wide variety of environments, the robot must rely on on-board state estimation which is prone to drift over time. We propose a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) exploration framework based on local submaps to allow retaining global consistency by applying loop-closure corrections to the relative submap poses. To enable large-scale exploration we efficiently compute global, environment-wide frontiers from the local submap frontiers and use a sampling-based next-best-view exploration planner. Our method seamlessly supports using either a LiDAR sensor or a depth camera, making it suitable for different kinds of MAV platforms. We perform comparative evaluations in simulation against a state-of-the-art submap-based exploration framework to showcase the efficiency and reconstruction quality of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to real-world MAVs, one equipped with a LiDAR and the other with a depth camera.

Specifically, for line matching process, we propose a novel geometric line optical flow algorithm that efficiently tracks line features with varying lengths, whitch is do not require detections and descriptors in every frame. To address the instability of Manhattan estimation from line features, we propose a tracking-by-detection module that consistently tracks and optimizes Manhattan framse in consecutive images. By aligning the Manhattan World with the VIO world frame, the tracking could restart using the latest pose from back-end, simplifying the coordinate transformations within the system. Furthermore, we implement a mechanism to validate Manhattan frames and a novel global structural constraints back-end optimization. Extensive experiments results on vairous datasets, including benchmark and self-collected datasets, show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and long-range robustness.

In this paper, we propose RUSSO, a robust underwater SLAM system which fuses stereo camera, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and imaging sonar to achieve robust and accurate localization in challenging underwater environments for 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) estimation. During visual degradation, the system is reduced to a sonar-inertial system estimating 3-DoF poses. The sonar pose estimation serves as a strong prior for IMU propagation, thereby enhancing the reliability of pose estimation with IMU propagation. Additionally, we propose a SLAM initialization method that leverages the imaging sonar to counteract the lack of visual features during the initialization stage of SLAM. We extensively validate RUSSO through experiments in simulator, pool, and sea scenarios. The results demonstrate that RUSSO achieves better robustness and localization accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, especially in visually challenging scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time fusing stereo camera, IMU, and imaging sonar to realize robust underwater SLAM against visual degradation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce LVI-GS, a tightly-coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial mapping framework with 3DGS, which leverages the complementary characteristics of LiDAR and image sensors to capture both geometric structures and visual details of 3D scenes. To this end, the 3D Gaussians are initialized from colourized LiDAR points and optimized using differentiable rendering. In order to achieve high-fidelity mapping, we introduce a pyramid-based training approach to effectively learn multi-level features and incorporate depth loss derived from LiDAR measurements to improve geometric feature perception. Through well-designed strategies for Gaussian-Map expansion, keyframe selection, thread management, and custom CUDA acceleration, our framework achieves real-time photo-realistic mapping. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuperVINS: A Real-Time Visual-Inertial SLAM Framework for Challenging Imaging Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21348v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional visual-inertial SLAM system often struggles with stability under low-light or motion-blur conditions, leading to potential lost of trajectory tracking. High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual-Inertial SLAM as Simple as A, B, VINS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05969v3)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AB-VINS, a different kind of visual-inertial SLAM system. Unlike most popular VINS methods which only use hand-crafted techniques, AB-VINS makes use of three different deep neural networks. Instead of estimating sparse feature positions, AB-VINS only estimates the scale and bias parameters (a and b) of monocular depth maps, as well as other terms to correct the depth using multi-view information, which results in a compressed feature state. Despite being an optimization-based system, the front-end motion tracking thread of AB-VINS surpasses the efficiency of a state-of-the-art filtering-based method while also providing dense depth. When performing loop closures, standard keyframe-based SLAM systems need to relinearize a number of variables which is linear with respect to the number of keyframes. In contrast, the proposed AB-VINS can incorporate loop closures while only affecting a constant number of variables. This is thanks to a novel data structure called the memory tree, where keyframe poses are defined relative to each other rather than all in one global frame, allowing for all but a few states to be fixed. While AB-VINS might not be as accurate as state-of-the-art VINS algorithms, it is shown to be more robust.</p></details> | Submitted to T-RO |
| **[Enhancing Visual Inertial SLAM with Magnetic Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09904v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an extension to visual inertial odometry (VIO) by introducing tightly-coupled fusion of magnetometer measurements. A sliding window of keyframes is optimized by minimizing re-projection errors, relative inertial errors, and relative magnetometer orientation errors. The results of IMU orientation propagation are used to efficiently transform magnetometer measurements between frames producing relative orientation constraints between consecutive frames. The soft and hard iron effects are calibrated using an ellipsoid fitting algorithm. The introduction of magnetometer data results in significant reductions in the orientation error and also in recovery of the true yaw orientation with respect to the magnetic north. The proposed framework operates in all environments with slow-varying magnetic fields, mainly outdoors and underwater. We have focused our work on the underwater domain, especially in underwater caves, as the narrow passage and turbulent flow make it difficult to perform loop closures and reset the localization drift. The underwater caves present challenges to VIO due to the absence of ambient light and the confined nature of the environment, while also being a crucial source of fresh water and providing valuable historical records. Experimental results from underwater caves demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and robustness introduced by the proposed VIO extension.</p></details> |  |

Its success depends on the performance of the pure stereo SLAM system and is based on the underlying assumption that pure visual SLAM can accurately estimate the camera trajectory, which is essential for inertial parameter estimation. Meanwhile, the further improved initialization method for ORB-SLAM3, known as Stereo-NEC, is time-consuming due to applying keypoint tracking to estimate gyroscope bias with normal epipolar constraints. To address the limitations of previous methods, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing translation accuracy during the initialization stage. The fundamental concept of our method is to improve the translation estimate with a 3 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) Bundle Adjustment (BA), independently, while the rotation estimate is fixed, instead of using ORB-SLAM3's 6-DoF BA. Additionally, the rotation estimate will be updated by considering IMU measurements and gyroscope bias, unlike ORB-SLAM3's rotation, which is directly obtained from stereo visual odometry and may yield inferior results when operating in challenging scenarios. We also conduct extensive evaluations on the public benchmark, the EuRoC dataset, demonstrating that our method excels in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The practical validity of our approach is supported by our experiments on public datasets.

But existing point-line-based SLAM methods mainly use Pl\"ucker matrix or orthogonal representation to represent a line, which needs to calculate at least four variables to determine a line. Given the numerous line features to determine in each frame, the overly flexible line representation increases the computation burden and comprises the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we propose inverse depth representation for a line, which models each extracted line feature using only two variables, i.e., the inverse depths of the two ending points. It exploits the fact that the projected line's pixel coordinates on the image plane are rather accurate, which partially restrict the line. Using this compact line presentation, Inverse Depth Line SLAM (IDLS) is proposed to track the line features in SLAM in an accurate and efficient way. A robust line triangulation method and a novel line re-projection error model are introduced. And a two-step optimization method is proposed to firstly determine the lines and then to estimate the camera poses in each frame. IDLS is extensively evaluated in multiple perceptually-challenging datasets. The results show it is more accurate, robust, and needs lower computational overhead than the current state-of-the-art of point-line-based SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |

However, how to make full use of visual information as well as better integrate with inertial measurement unit (IMU) in visual SLAM has potential research value. This paper proposes a novel deep SLAM network with dual visual factors. The basic idea is to integrate both photometric factor and re-projection factor into the end-to-end differentiable structure through multi-factor data association module. We show that the proposed network dynamically learns and adjusts the confidence maps of both visual factors and it can be further extended to include the IMU factors as well. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets, including TartanAir, EuRoC and ETH3D-SLAM.

Despite their advancements, these methods often encounter dead-reckoning errors that leads to considerable drift in estimated platform motion especially during long traverses. In such cases, the drift error is not negligible and should be rectified. Our proposed approach minimizes the drift error by correcting the estimated motion generated by any SLAM method at each epoch. Our methodology treats positioning measurements rendered by the SLAM solution as random variables formulated jointly in a multivariate distribution. In this setting, The correction of the drift becomes equivalent to finding the mode of this multivariate distribution which jointly maximizes the likelihood of a set of relevant geo-spatial priors about the platform motion and environment. Our method is integrable into any SLAM/VIO method as an correction module. Our experimental results shows the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing the drift error by 10x in long treverses.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the current state-of-the-art method, which heavily relies on the accuracy of a pure visual SLAM system to estimate inertial variables without updating camera poses, potentially compromising accuracy and robustness, our approach offers a different solution. We realize the crucial impact of precise gyroscope bias estimation on rotation accuracy. This, in turn, affects trajectory accuracy due to the accumulation of translation errors. To address this, we first independently estimate the gyroscope bias and use it to formulate a maximum a posteriori problem for further refinement. After this refinement, we proceed to update the rotation estimation by performing IMU integration with gyroscope bias removed from gyroscope measurements. We then leverage robust and accurate rotation estimates to enhance translation estimation via 3-DoF bundle adjustment. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for determining the success of the initialization by evaluating the residual of the normal epipolar constraint. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC dataset illustrate that our method excels in accuracy and robustness. It outperforms ORB-SLAM3, the current leading stereo visual-inertial initialization method, in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative rotation error, while maintaining competitive computational speed. Notably, even with 5 keyframes for initialization, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach using 10 keyframes in rotation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our system relies solely on onboard IMU measurements, stereo infrared images, and depth images and autonomously corrects teleoperated inputs when they are deemed unsafe. We define a point in 3D space as unsafe if it satisfies either of two conditions: (i) it is occupied by an obstacle, or (ii) it remains unmapped. At each time step, an occupancy map of the environment is updated by the VI-SLAM by fusing the onboard measurements, and a CBF is constructed to parameterize the (un)safe region in the 3D space. Given the CBF and state feedback from the VI-SLAM module, a safety filter computes a certified reference that best matches the teleoperation input while satisfying the safety constraint encoded by the CBF. In contrast to existing perception-based safe control frameworks, we directly close the perception-action loop and demonstrate the full capability of safe control in combination with real-time VI-SLAM without any external infrastructure or prior knowledge of the environment. We verify the efficacy of the perceptive safety filter in real-time MAV experiments using exclusively onboard sensing and computation and show that the teleoperated MAV is able to safely navigate through unknown environments despite arbitrary inputs sent by the teleoperator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024, 7 pages, 7 figures, supplementary video is available at https://youtu.be/rCxbWY4PIfQ?si=DC-9mg7g1WooNdaV</p></details> |

| **[A Plug-and-Play Learning-based IMU Bias Factor for Robust Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12527v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable estimation of biases of low-cost Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) is a key factor to maintain the resilience of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), particularly when visual tracking fails in challenging areas. In such cases, bias estimates from the VIO can deviate significantly from the real values because of the insufficient or erroneous vision features, compromising both localization accuracy and system stability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel plug-and-play module featuring the Inertial Prior Network (IPNet), which infers an IMU bias prior by implicitly capturing the motion characteristics of specific platforms. The core idea is inspired intuitively by the observation that different platforms exhibit distinctive motion patterns, while the integration of low-cost IMU measurements suffers from unbounded error that quickly accumulates over time. Therefore, these specific motion patterns can be exploited to infer the underlying IMU bias. In this work, we first directly infer the biases prior only using the raw IMU data using a sliding window approach, eliminating the dependency on recursive bias estimation combining visual features, thus effectively preventing error propagation in challenging areas. Moreover, to compensate for the lack of ground-truth bias in most visual-inertial datasets, we further introduce an iterative method to compute the mean per-sequence IMU bias for network training and release it to benefit society. The framework is trained and evaluated separately on two public datasets and a self-collected dataset. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves localization precision and robustness.</p></details> |  |

FPSPs greatly improve latency, reducing the problems associated with the bottleneck of data transfer from a vision sensor to a processor. FPSPs accelerate vision-based algorithms such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO). However, VIO frameworks suffer from spatial drift due to the vision-based pose estimation, whilst temporal drift arises from the inertial measurements. FPSPs circumvent the spatial drift by operating at a high frame rate to match the high-frequency output of the inertial measurements.

Recent work has shown that an invariant formulation of the extended Kalman filter improves the convergence and robustness of visual-inertial odometry by utilizing the Lie group structure of a robot's position, velocity, and orientation states. However, inertial sensors also require measurement bias estimation, yet introducing the bias in the filter state breaks the Lie group symmetry. In this paper, we design a neural network to predict the bias of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) from a sequence of previous IMU measurements. This allows us to use an invariant filter for visual inertial odometry, relying on the learned bias prediction rather than introducing the bias in the filter state. We demonstrate that an invariant multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) with learned bias predictions achieves robust visual-inertial odometry in real experiments, even when visual information is unavailable for extended periods and the system needs to rely solely on IMU measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Statistical Uncertainty Learning for Robust Visual-Inertial State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01648v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is to dynamically assess the reliability of sensor measurements. This assessment is crucial for properly weighting the contribution of each measurement to the state estimate. Conventional methods often simplify this by assuming a static, uniform uncertainty for all measurements. This heuristic, however, may be limited in its ability to capture the dynamic error characteristics inherent in real-world data. To improve this limitation, we present a statistical framework that learns measurement reliability assessment online, directly from sensor data and optimization results. Our approach leverages multi-view geometric consistency as a form of self-supervision. This enables the system to infer landmark uncertainty and adaptively weight visual measurements during optimization. We evaluated our method on the public EuRoC dataset, demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy with average reductions of approximately 24\% in translation error and 42\% in rotation error compared to baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters. The resulting framework operates in real time while showing enhanced accuracy and robustness. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings enhance panel performance but degrade over time, requiring periodic reapplication. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible and autonomous way to apply protective coatings more often and at lower cost compared to traditional manual coating methods. In this letter, we propose a quadcopter-based system, equipped with a liquid dispersion mechanism, designed to automate such tasks. The localization stack only uses onboard sensors, relying on visual-inertial odometry and the relative position of the PV panel detected with respect to the quadcopter. The control relies on a model-based controller that accounts for the ground effect and the mass decrease of the quadcopter during liquid dispersion. We validate the autonomy capabilities of our system through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 10 figures.

| **[An Extended Kalman Filter for Systems with Infinite-Dimensional Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18749v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article examines state estimation in discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems with finite-dimensional states and infinite-dimensional measurements, motivated by real-world applications such as vision-based localization and tracking. We develop an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for real-time state estimation, with the measurement noise modeled as an infinite-dimensional random field. When applied to vision-based state estimation, the measurement Jacobians required to implement the EKF are shown to correspond to image gradients. This result provides a novel system-theoretic justification for the use of image gradients as features for vision-based state estimation, contrasting with their (often heuristic) introduction in many computer-vision pipelines. We demonstrate the practical utility of the EKF on a public real-world dataset involving the localization of an aerial drone using video from a downward-facing monocular camera. The EKF is shown to outperform VINS-MONO, an established visual-inertial odometry algorithm, in some cases achieving mean squared error reductions of up to an order of magnitude.</p></details> | 8 pages |

This paper presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips (SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods, was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24 pixels/frame.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IoT-J)</p></details> |
| **[Detection and Recovery of Adversarial Slow-Pose Drift in Offloaded Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07130v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose. However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities. Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense baseline.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 8 Figures |
| **[ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-LVI-SAM: A Robust LiDAR-Visual-Inertial Odometry for Multiple Fisheye Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05740v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework, Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[HDVIO2.0: Wind and Disturbance Estimation with Hybrid Dynamics VIO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00969v3)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is widely used for state estimation in autonomous micro aerial vehicles using onboard sensors. Current methods improve VIO by incorporating a model of the translational vehicle dynamics, yet their performance degrades when faced with low-accuracy vehicle models or continuous external disturbances, like wind. Additionally, incorporating rotational dynamics in these models is computationally intractable when they are deployed in online applications, e.g., in a closed-loop control system. We present HDVIO2.0, which models full 6-DoF, translational and rotational, vehicle dynamics and tightly incorporates them into a VIO with minimal impact on the runtime. HDVIO2.0 builds upon the previous work, HDVIO, and addresses these challenges through a hybrid dynamics model combining a point-mass vehicle model with a learning-based component, with access to control commands and IMU history, to capture complex aerodynamic effects. The key idea behind modeling the rotational dynamics is to represent them with continuous-time functions. HDVIO2.0 leverages the divergence between the actual motion and the predicted motion from the hybrid dynamics model to estimate external forces as well as the robot state. Our system surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in experiments using public and new drone dynamics datasets, as well as real-world flights in winds up to 25 km/h. Unlike existing approaches, we also show that accurate vehicle dynamics predictions are achievable without precise knowledge of the full vehicle state.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 2025</p></details> |

The proposed solution estimates body-frame velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data. This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer, which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on $\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through simulation results.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

XR-NPE is first to support FP4, Posit (4,1), Posit (8,0), and Posit (16,1) formats, with layer adaptive hybrid-algorithmic implementation supporting ultra-low bit precision to significantly reduce memory bandwidth requirements, and accompanied by quantization-aware training for minimal accuracy loss. The proposed Reconfigurable Mantissa Multiplication and Exponent processing Circuitry (RMMEC) reduces dark silicon in the SIMD MAC compute engine, assisted by selective power gating to reduce energy consumption, providing 2.85x improved arithmetic intensity. XR-NPE achieves a maximum operating frequency of 1.72 GHz, area 0.016 mm2 , and arithmetic intensity 14 pJ at CMOS 28nm, reducing 42% area, 38% power compared to the best of state-of-the-art MAC approaches. The proposed XR-NPE based AXI-enabled Matrix-multiplication co-processor consumes 1.4x fewer LUTs, 1.77x fewer FFs, and provides 1.2x better energy efficiency compared to SoTA accelerators on VCU129. The proposed co-processor provides 23% better energy efficiency and 4% better compute density for VIO workloads.

Previous work is mainly applicable to static or quasi-static scenes, and its performance significantly deteriorates when both the object and the camera move rapidly. To overcome these challenges, we propose three synergistic components: (1) A visual-inertial odometry compensates for the shift in the Region of Interest (ROI) caused by camera motion; (2) A depth-informed 2D tracker corrects ROI deviations caused by large object translation; (3) A VIO-guided Kalman filter predicts object rotation, generates multiple candidate poses, and then obtains the final pose by hierarchical refinement. The 6D pose tracking results guide subsequent 2D tracking and Kalman filter updates, forming a closed-loop system that ensures accurate pose initialization and precise pose tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving real-time and robust 6D pose tracking for fast-moving cameras and objects.</p></details> |  |

Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states. Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace, thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and consistency compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it usually suffers from high computational burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While advancements in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0 license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

Numerous researchers have proposed optimization-based multi-robot localization methods that use camera, IMU, and UWB sensors. Nevertheless, characteristics of individual robot odometry estimates and distance measurements between robots used in the optimization are not sufficiently considered. In addition, previous researches were heavily influenced by the odometry accuracy that is estimated from individual robots. Consequently, long-term drift error caused by error accumulation is potentially inevitable. In this paper, we propose a novel visual-inertial-range-based multi-robot localization method, named SaWa-ML, which enables geometric structure-aware pose correction and weight adaptation-based robust multi-robot localization. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we leverage UWB sensor data, whose range error does not accumulate over time, to first estimate the relative positions between robots and then correct the positions of each robot, thus reducing long-term drift errors, (ii) we design adaptive weights for robot pose correction by considering the characteristics of the sensor data and visual-inertial odometry estimates. The proposed method has been validated in real-world experiments, showing a substantial performance increase compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Whereas visual inertial odometry (VIO) accumulates drift over time, scene coordinate regression (SCR) yields drift-free, high accuracy absolute pose estimation. We present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15% (40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively. Moreover, hardware in the loop experiment validates the feasibility of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, the inherent noise in event streams complicates the selection of high-quality map points, which critically determine the precision of state estimation. To address this challenge, we propose Voxel-ESVIO, an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes voxel map management, which efficiently filter out high-quality 3D points. Specifically, our methodology utilizes voxel-based point selection and voxel-aware point management to collectively optimize the selection and updating of map points on a per-voxel basis. These synergistic strategies enable the efficient retrieval of noise-resilient map points with the highest observation likelihood in current frames, thereby ensureing the state estimation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our Voxel-ESVIO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The distinct relationships between quadrotor-quadrotor and quadrotor-target interactions are evaluated using a heterogeneous perception strategy and corresponding state estimation algorithms. A modified Kalman filter is developed to fuse visual-inertial odometry with range measurements to enhance the accuracy of inter-quadrotor relative localization. An event-triggered distributed Kalman filter is designed to achieve robust target state estimation under visual occlusion by incorporating neighbor measurements and estimated inter-quadrotor relative positions. Using the estimation results, a cooperative circumnavigation controller is constructed, leveraging an oscillator-based autonomous formation flight strategy. We conduct extensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the efficiency of the proposed circumnavigation framework in occluded environments.

As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain, which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings. LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.</p></details> |  |

The method is designed for localization solutions where UWB modules act as supplementary sensors. Our approach enables the automatic detection and calibration of previously unknown anchors during operation, removing the need for manual setup. By combining an online Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP) estimation, a lightweight outlier detection method, and an adaptive robust kernel for non-linear optimization, our approach significantly improves robustness and suitability for real-world applications compared to state-of-the-art. In particular, we show that our metric which triggers an initialization decision is more conservative than current ones commonly based on initial linear or non-linear initialization guesses. This allows for better initialization geometry and subsequently lower initialization errors. We demonstrate the proposed approach on two different mobile robots: an autonomous forklift and a quadcopter equipped with a UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) framework. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method with robust initialization and low positioning error. We open-source our code in a C++ library including a ROS wrapper.</p></details> |  |

The estimation of a visual map relies on accurate localization information. Meanwhile, localization requires precise map points to provide motion constraints. This classical design principle is naturally inherited by visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Efficient localization solutions that do not require a map have not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose a novel structureless VIO, where the visual map is removed from the odometry framework.

However, limited research has explored the integration of motor-encoder devices to enhance SLAM performance. By incorporating such devices, it is possible to significantly improve active capability and field of view (FOV) with minimal additional cost and structural complexity. This paper proposes a novel visual-inertial-encoder tightly coupled odometry (VIEO) based on a ViDAR (Video Detection and Ranging) device. A ViDAR calibration method is introduced to ensure accurate initialization for VIEO. In addition, a platform motion decoupled active SLAM method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Experimental data demonstrate that the proposed ViDAR and the VIEO algorithm significantly increase cross-frame co-visibility relationships compared to its corresponding visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm, improving state estimation accuracy. Additionally, the DRL-based active SLAM algorithm, with the ability to decouple from platform motion, can increase the diversity weight of the feature points and further enhance the VIEO algorithm's performance. The proposed methodology sheds fresh insights into both the updated platform design and decoupled approach of active SLAM systems in complex environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures |

The proposed solution harnesses the power of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, visual-inertial odometry (VIO), inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to generate reliable 3D odometry. To further enhance the localization accuracy, Visual SLAM (VSLAM) is employed, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive 3D point cloud map. By leveraging these sensor technologies and advanced algorithms, the prototype offers a comprehensive solution for outdoor localization in autonomous mobile robots, enabling them to navigate and map their surroundings with confidence and precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to WAF 2023: Workshop de Agentes Fisicos</p></details> |

Olfactory inertial odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types. Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a full conference paper at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Inertial Sensors & Systems</p></details> |
| **[Photoreal Scene Reconstruction from an Egocentric Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04444v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed image formation model.

Navigation by machine olfaction (artificial smell) is a very difficult task to both simulate and solve. With this work, we define olfactory inertial odometry (OIO), a framework for using inertial kinematics, and fast-sampling olfaction sensors to enable navigation by scent analogous to visual inertial odometry (VIO). We establish how principles from SLAM and VIO can be extrapolated to olfaction to enable real-world robotic tasks. We demonstrate OIO with three different odour localization algorithms on a real 5-DoF robot arm over an odour-tracking scenario that resembles real applications in agriculture and food quality control. Our results indicate success in establishing a baseline framework for OIO from which other research in olfactory navigation can build, and we note performance enhancements that can be made to address more complex tasks in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Localization, Mapping, and Navigation for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02272v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadruped robots are currently a widespread platform for robotics research, thanks to powerful Reinforcement Learning controllers and the availability of cheap and robust commercial platforms. However, to broaden the adoption of the technology in the real world, we require robust navigation stacks relying only on low-cost sensors such as depth cameras. This paper presents a first step towards a robust localization, mapping, and navigation system for low-cost quadruped robots. In pursuit of this objective we combine contact-aided kinematic, visual-inertial odometry, and depth-stabilized vision, enhancing stability and accuracy of the system. Our results in simulation and two different real-world quadruped platforms show that our system can generate an accurate 2D map of the environment, robustly localize itself, and navigate autonomously. Furthermore, we present in-depth ablation studies of the important components of the system and their impact on localization accuracy.

Their smaller size fosters easy integration into human environments. Nevertheless, real-time locomotion on uneven terrains remains challenging, particularly due to the high computational demands of terrain perception. This paper presents a robust reinforcement learning-based exteroceptive locomotion controller for resource-constrained small-scale quadrupeds in challenging terrains, which exploits real-time elevation mapping, supported by a careful depth sensor selection. We concurrently train both a policy and a state estimator, which together provide an odometry source for elevation mapping, optionally fused with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). We demonstrate the importance of positioning an additional time-of-flight sensor for maintaining robustness even without VIO, thus having the potential to free up computational resources. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed controller can flawlessly traverse steps up to 17.5 cm in height and achieve an 80% success rate on 22.5 cm steps, both with and without VIO. The proposed controller also achieves accurate forward and yaw velocity tracking of up to 1.0 m/s and 1.5 rad/s respectively.

| **[Edge-Enabled VIO with Long-Tracked Features for High-Accuracy Low-Altitude IoT Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06517v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) method using long-tracked features. Long-tracked features can constrain more visual frames, reducing localization drift. However, they may also lead to accumulated matching errors and drift in feature tracking. Current VIO methods adjust observation weights based on re-projection errors, yet this approach has flaws. Re-projection errors depend on estimated camera poses and map points, so increased errors might come from estimation inaccuracies, not actual feature tracking errors. This can mislead the optimization process and make long-tracked features ineffective for suppressing localization drift. Furthermore, long-tracked features constrain a larger number of frames, which poses a significant challenge to real-time performance of the system. To tackle these issues, we propose an active decoupling mechanism for accumulated errors in long-tracked feature utilization. We introduce a visual reference frame reset strategy to eliminate accumulated tracking errors and a depth prediction strategy to leverage the long-term constraint. To ensure real time preformane, we implement three strategies for efficient system state estimation: a parallel elimination strategy based on predefined elimination order, an inverse-depth elimination simplification strategy, and an elimination skipping strategy. Experiments on various datasets show that our method offers higher positioning accuracy with relatively short consumption time, making it more suitable for edge-enabled low-altitude IoT navigation, where high-accuracy positioning and real-time operation on edge device are required. The code will be published at github.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages with 9 figures</p></details> |

This framework enables high-precision and highly robust real-time state estimation and map construction in challenging environments, such as LiDAR-degraded, low-texture regions, and feature-scarce areas. The LPVIMO-SAM comprises two subsystems: a Polarized Vision-Inertial System and a LiDAR/Inertial/Magnetometer/Optical Flow System. The polarized vision enhances the robustness of the Visual/Inertial odometry in low-feature and low-texture scenarios by extracting the polarization information of the scene. The magnetometer acquires the heading angle, and the optical flow obtains the speed and height to reduce the accumulated error. A magnetometer heading prior factor, an optical flow speed observation factor, and a height observation factor are designed to eliminate the cumulative errors of the LiDAR/Inertial odometry through factor graph optimization. Meanwhile, the LPVIMO-SAM can maintain stable positioning even when one of the two subsystems fails, further expanding its applicability in LiDAR-degraded, low-texture, and low-feature environments.

| **[Debiasing 6-DOF IMU via Hierarchical Learning of Continuous Bias Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09495v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a deep learning approach to the online debiasing of IMU gyroscopes and accelerometers. Most existing methods rely on implicitly learning a bias term to compensate for raw IMU data. Explicit bias learning has recently shown its potential as a more interpretable and motion-independent alternative. However, it remains underexplored and faces challenges, particularly the need for ground truth bias data, which is rarely available. To address this, we propose a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) framework that explicitly models continuous bias dynamics, requiring only pose ground truth, often available in datasets. This is achieved by extending the canonical NODE framework to the matrix Lie group for IMU kinematics with a hierarchical training strategy. The validation on two public datasets and one real-world experiment demonstrates significant accuracy improvements in IMU measurements, reducing errors in both pure IMU integration and visual-inertial odometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Robotics: Science and Systems, 2025</p></details> |

This dataset comprises 217 minutes of flight time over 36 experiments using three quadcopters, collecting ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging data such as the raw timestamps and channel-impulse response data, vision data from a stereo camera and a bottom-facing monocular camera, inertial measurement unit data, height measurements from a laser rangefinder, magnetometer data, and ground-truth poses from a motion-capture system. The UWB data is collected from up to 12 transceivers affixed to mobile robots and static tripods in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions. The UAVs fly at a maximum speed of 4.418 m/s in an indoor environment with visual fiducial markers as features. MILUV is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications beyond localization, but the primary purpose of MILUV is for testing and validating multi-robot UWB- and vision-based localization algorithms. The dataset can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.28386041.v1.

A systematic study of this problem is essential for many safety-critical robotic applications that rely on the measurements from learned perception modules. We consider a (small) team of quadrotor robots that rely only on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the visual data measurements obtained from a learned multi-task perception module (e.g., object detection) for downstream tasks, including relative localization and coordination. We focus on a class of adversarial perception attacks that cause misclassification, mislocalization, and latency. We propose that the effects of adversarial misclassification and mislocalization can be modeled as sporadic (intermittent) and spurious measurement data for the downstream tasks. To address this, we present a framework for resilience analysis of multi-robot coordination with adversarial measurements. The framework integrates data from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the learned perception model for robust relative localization and state estimation in the presence of adversarially sporadic and spurious measurements. The framework allows for quantifying the degradation in system observability and stability in relation to the success rate of adversarial perception. Finally, experimental results on a multi-robot platform demonstrate the real-world applicability of our methodology for resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at the 2025 Int'l Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</p></details> |
| **[Flying through Moving Gates without Full State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15799v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous drone racing requires powerful perception, planning, and control and has become a benchmark and test field for autonomous, agile flight. Existing work usually assumes static race tracks with known maps, which enables offline planning of time-optimal trajectories, performing localization to the gates to reduce the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) for state estimation or training learning-based methods for the particular race track and operating environment. In contrast, many real-world tasks like disaster response or delivery need to be performed in unknown and dynamic environments. To make drone racing more robust against unseen environments and moving gates, we propose a control algorithm that operates without a race track map or VIO, relying solely on monocular measurements of the line of sight to the gates. For this purpose, we adopt the law of proportional navigation (PN) to accurately fly through the gates despite gate motions or wind. We formulate the PN-informed vision-based control problem for drone racing as a constrained optimization problem and derive a closed-form optimal solution. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm can navigate through moving gates at high speeds while being robust to different gate movements, model errors, wind, and delays.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Providing valuable contextual information about the environment, the prior map is a vital tool for mitigating drift. In this paper, we propose a map-based visual-inertial localization algorithm (NeRF-VIO) with initialization using neural radiance fields (NeRF). Our algorithm utilizes a multilayer perceptron model and redefines the loss function as the geodesic distance on \(SE(3)\), ensuring the invariance of the initialization model under a frame change within \(\mathfrak{se}(3)\). The evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing NeRF-based initialization solution in both accuracy and efficiency. By integrating a two-stage update mechanism within a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, the state of NeRF-VIO is constrained by both captured images from an onboard camera and rendered images from a pre-trained NeRF model. The proposed algorithm is validated using a real-world AR dataset, the results indicate that our two-stage update pipeline outperforms MSCKF across all data sequences.</p></details> |  |

However, the filter-based method has the problem of insufficient accuracy. To this end, we propose the State transformation and Pose-only VIO (SP-VIO) by rebuilding the state and measurement models, and considering further visual deprived conditions. In detail, we first proposed the double state transformation extended Kalman filter (DST-EKF) to replace the standard extended Kalman filter (Std-EKF) for improving the system's consistency, and then adopt pose-only (PO) visual description to avoid the linearization error caused by 3D feature estimation. The comprehensive observability analysis shows that SP-VIO has a more stable unobservable subspace, which can better avoid the inconsistency problem caused by spurious information. Moreover, we propose an enhanced double state transformation Rauch-Tung-Striebel (DST-RTS) backtracking method to optimize motion trajectories during visual interruption. Monte-Carlo simulations and real-world experiments show that SP-VIO has better accuracy and efficiency than state-of-the-art (SOTA) VIO algorithms, and has better robustness under visual deprived conditions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, for line matching process, we propose a novel geometric line optical flow algorithm that efficiently tracks line features with varying lengths, whitch is do not require detections and descriptors in every frame. To address the instability of Manhattan estimation from line features, we propose a tracking-by-detection module that consistently tracks and optimizes Manhattan framse in consecutive images. By aligning the Manhattan World with the VIO world frame, the tracking could restart using the latest pose from back-end, simplifying the coordinate transformations within the system. Furthermore, we implement a mechanism to validate Manhattan frames and a novel global structural constraints back-end optimization. Extensive experiments results on vairous datasets, including benchmark and self-collected datasets, show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and long-range robustness.

However, real-world scenes often feature dynamic objects, compromising the accuracy of VIO. The diversity and partial occlusion of these objects present a tough challenge for existing dynamic VIO methods. To tackle this challenge, we introduce ADUGS-VINS, which integrates an enhanced SORT algorithm along with a promptable foundation model into VIO, thereby improving pose estimation accuracy in environments with diverse dynamic objects and frequent occlusions. We evaluated our proposed method using multiple public datasets representing various scenes, as well as in a real-world scenario involving diverse dynamic objects. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs impressively in multiple scenarios, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. This highlights its remarkable generalization and adaptability in diverse dynamic environments, showcasing its potential to handle various dynamic objects in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the self-emergent adaptive sensor weighting reveals how XIRVIO attends to each sensory input based on contextual cues in the data, making it a promising approach for achieving explainability in safety-critical VIO applications. Evaluations on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that XIRVIO matches well-known state-of-the-art learning-based methods in terms of both translation and rotation errors.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

To successfully bootstrap VIO algorithms, the initialization module is extremely important. Most initialization methods rely on the reconstruction of 3D visual point clouds. These methods suffer from high computational cost as state vector contains both motion states and 3D feature points. To address this issue, some researchers recently proposed a structureless initialization method, which can solve the initial state without recovering 3D structure. However, this method potentially compromises performance due to the decoupled estimation of rotation and translation, as well as linear constraints. To improve its accuracy, we propose novel structureless visual-inertial bundle adjustment to further refine previous structureless solution. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our method significantly improves the VIO initialization accuracy, while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

During initialization, it is crucial to estimate parameters such as accelerometer bias, gyroscope bias, initial velocity, gravity, etc. Most existing VIO initialization methods adopt Structure from Motion (SfM) to solve for gyroscope bias. However, SfM is not stable and efficient enough in fast-motion or degenerate scenes. To overcome these limitations, we extended the rotation-translation-decoupled framework by adding new uncertainty parameters and optimization modules. First, we adopt a gyroscope bias estimator that incorporates probabilistic normal epipolar constraints. Second, we fuse IMU and visual measurements to solve for velocity, gravity, and scale efficiently. Finally, we design an additional refinement module that effectively reduces gravity and scale errors. Extensive EuRoC dataset tests show that our method reduces gyroscope bias and rotation errors by 16\% and 4\% on average, and gravity error by 29\% on average. On the TUM dataset, our method reduces the gravity error and scale error by 14.2\% and 5.7\% on average respectively.

These systems, including LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), often face challenges in localization due to adverse environmental conditions such as dust, smoke, and limited visual features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel head-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset with ground truth, aimed at advancing data-driven IMU pose estimation. Our dataset captures human head motion patterns using a helmet-mounted system, with data from ten participants performing various activities. We explore the application of neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to correct IMU biases and improve localization accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of these methods across different IMU data window dimensions, motion patterns, and sensor types.

The method exploits a recurrent neural network using as inputs inertial cues, motor commands, and battery voltage readings alongside the hidden state of the previous time-step to output robust velocity estimates and their associated uncertainty. An ensemble of networks is utilized to enhance the velocity and uncertainty predictions. Fusing the network's outputs into an Extended Kalman Filter, alongside inertial predictions and barometer updates, the method enables long-term underwater odometry without further exteroception. Furthermore, when integrated into visual-inertial odometry, the method assists in enhanced estimation resilience when dealing with an order of magnitude fewer total features tracked (as few as 1) as compared to conventional visual-inertial systems. Tested onboard an underwater robot deployed both in a laboratory pool and the Trondheim Fjord, the method takes less than 5ms for inference either on the CPU or the GPU of an NVIDIA Orin AGX and demonstrates less than 4% relative position error in novel trajectories during complete visual blackout, and approximately 2% relative error when a maximum of 2 visual features from a monocular camera are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2025), Atlanta, USA</p></details> |

For a general nonlinear system, we discover and theoretically prove that the unobservable subspace of the EKF estimator system is independent of the state and belongs to the unobservable subspace of the original system. On this basis, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving observability matching. These theoretical findings motivate us to introduce a linear time-varying transformation to achieve a transformed system possessing a state-independent unobservable subspace. We prove the existence of such transformations and propose two design methodologies for constructing them. Moreover, we propose two equivalent consistent transformation-based EKF estimators, referred to as T-EKF 1 and T-EKF 2, respectively. T-EKF 1 employs the transformed system for consistent estimation, whereas T-EKF 2 leverages the original system but ensures consistency through state and covariance corrections from transformations. To validate our proposed methods, we conduct experiments on several representative examples, including multi-robot cooperative localization, multi-source target tracking, and 3D visual-inertial odometry, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, consistency, computational efficiency, and practical realizations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce FastUMI, a substantial redesign of the Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) system that addresses these challenges by enabling rapid deployment, simplifying hardware-software integration, and delivering robust performance in real-world data acquisition. Compared with UMI, FastUMI has several advantages: 1) It adopts a decoupled hardware design and incorporates extensive mechanical modifications, removing dependencies on specialized robotic components while preserving consistent observation perspectives. 2) It also refines the algorithmic pipeline by replacing complex Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) implementations with an off-the-shelf tracking module, significantly reducing deployment complexity while maintaining accuracy. 3) FastUMI includes an ecosystem for data collection, verification, and integration with both established and newly developed imitation learning algorithms, accelerating policy learning advancement. Additionally, we have open-sourced a high-quality dataset of over 10,000 real-world demonstration trajectories spanning 22 everyday tasks, forming one of the most diverse UMI-like datasets to date. Experimental results confirm that FastUMI facilitates rapid deployment, reduces operational costs and labor demands, and maintains robust performance across diverse manipulation scenarios, thereby advancing scalable data-driven robotic learning.</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile Locomotion Skills for Hexapod Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10628v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hexapod robots are potentially suitable for carrying out tasks in cluttered environments since they are stable, compact, and light weight. They also have multi-joint legs and variable height bodies that make them good candidates for tasks such as stairs climbing and squeezing under objects in a typical home environment or an attic. Expanding on our previous work on joist climbing in attics, we train a legged hexapod equipped with a depth camera and visual inertial odometry (VIO) to perform three tasks: climbing stairs, avoiding obstacles, and squeezing under obstacles such as a table. Our policies are trained with simulation data only and can be deployed on lowcost hardware not requiring real-time joint state feedback. We train our model in a teacher-student model with 2 phases: In phase 1, we use reinforcement learning with access to privileged information such as height maps and joint feedback. In phase 2, we use supervised learning to distill the model into one with access to only onboard observations, consisting of egocentric depth images and robot pose captured by a tracking VIO camera. By manipulating available privileged information, constructing simulation terrains, and refining reward functions during phase 1 training, we are able to train the robots with skills that are robust in non-ideal physical environments. We demonstrate successful sim-to-real transfer and achieve high success rates across all three tasks in physical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08496v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Aerial Collaborative Stereo: Real-Time Cross-Camera Feature Association and Relative Pose Estimation for UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17504v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collaborative visual perception of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increasingly become a research hotspot. Compared to a single UAV equipped with a short-baseline stereo camera, multi-UAV collaborative vision offers a wide and variable baseline, providing potential benefits in flexible and large-scale depth perception. In this paper, we propose the concept of a collaborative stereo camera, where the left and right cameras are mounted on two UAVs that share an overlapping FOV. Considering the dynamic flight of two UAVs in the real world, the FOV and relative pose of the left and right cameras are continuously changing. Compared to fixed-baseline stereo cameras, this aerial collaborative stereo system introduces two challenges, which are highly real-time requirements for dynamic cross-camera stereo feature association and relative pose estimation of left and right cameras. To address these challenges, we first propose a real-time dual-channel feature association algorithm with a guidance-prediction structure. Then, we propose a Relative Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (Rel-MSCKF) algorithm to estimate the relative pose by fusing co-visual features and UAVs' visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Extensive experiments are performed on the popular onboard computer NVIDIA NX. Results on the resource-constrained platform show that the real-time performance of the dual-channel feature association is significantly superior to traditional methods. The convergence of Rel-MSCKF is assessed under different initial baseline errors. In the end, we present a potential application of aerial collaborative stereo for remote mapping obstacles in urban scenarios. We hope this work can serve as a foundational study for more multi-UAV collaborative vision research. Online video: https://youtu.be/avxMuOf5Qcw</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, during long-term use, irreversible structural deformation caused by temperature changes, mechanical squeezing, etc. will cause changes in extrinsic parameters, especially in the rotational part. Existing initialization methods that simultaneously estimate extrinsic parameters suffer from poor robustness, low precision, and long initialization latency due to the need for sufficient translational motion. To address these problems, we propose a novel VIO initialization method, which jointly considers extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias within the normal epipolar constraints, achieving higher precision and better robustness without delayed rotational calibration. First, a rotation-only constraint is designed for extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias estimation, which tightly couples gyroscope measurements and visual observations and can be solved in pure-rotation cases. Second, we propose a weighting strategy together with a failure detection strategy to enhance the precision and robustness of the estimator. Finally, we leverage Maximum A Posteriori to refine the results before enough translation parallax comes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness while maintaining competitive efficiency.</p></details> |  |

These environments are typically challenging for conventional vision-based state estimation due to the lack of distinct visual landmarks and the instability of vehicle poses. To address this, BEVRender generates high-quality local bird's-eye-view(BEV) images of the local terrain. Subsequently, these images are aligned with a geo referenced aerial map through template matching to achieve accurate cross-view registration. Our approach overcomes the inherent limitations of visual inertial odometry systems and the substantial storage requirements of image-retrieval localization strategies, which are susceptible to drift and scalability issues, respectively. Extensive experimentation validates BEVRender's advancement over existing GNSS-denied visual localization methods, demonstrating notable enhancements in both localization accuracy and update frequency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by IROS2024</p></details> |

The cutting-edge DU-VIO framework is incorporating a GAN-based pre-processing module and a hybrid CNN-LSTM module for precise pose estimation, using visibility-enhanced underwater images and raw IMU data. Accurate pose estimation is paramount for various underwater robotics and exploration applications. However, underwater visibility is often compromised by suspended particles and attenuation effects, rendering visual-inertial pose estimation a formidable challenge. DU-VIO aims to overcome these limitations by effectively removing visual disturbances from raw image data, enhancing the quality of image features used for pose estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DU-VIO by calculating RMSE scores for translation and rotation vectors in comparison to their reference values. These scores are then compared to those of a base model using a modified AQUALOC Dataset. This study's significance lies in its potential to revolutionize underwater robotics and exploration. DU-VIO offers a robust solution to the persistent challenge of underwater visibility, significantly improving the accuracy of pose estimation. This research contributes valuable insights and tools for advancing underwater technology, with far-reaching implications for scientific research, environmental monitoring, and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Improved Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter for Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08117v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast pose estimation (PE) is of vital importance for successful mission performance of agile autonomous robots. Global Positioning Systems such as GPS and GNSS have been typically used in fusion with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for PE. However, the low update rate and lack of proper signals make their utility impractical for indoor and urban applications. On the other hand, Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is gaining popularity as a practical alternative for GNSS/INS systems in GPS-denied environments. Among the many VIO-based methods, the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) has received a greater attention due to its robustness, speed and accuracy. To this end, the high computational cost associated with image processing for real-time implementation of MSCKF on resource-constrained vehicles is still a challenging ongoing research. In this paper, an enhanced version of the MSCKF is proposed. To this aim, different feature marginalization and state pruning strategies are suggested that result in a much faster algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested both on an open-source dataset and in real-world experiments for validation. It is demonstrated that the proposed Fast-MSCKF (FMSCKF) is about six times faster and at least 20% more accurate in final position estimation than the standard MSCKF algorithm.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning-based (DL) methods excel at inferring semantic object information from images, such as class and relative 6 degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose, they are computationally demanding and thus often not suitable for payload constrained mobile robots. In this letter we present a real-time capable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system for object-relative, closed-loop navigation with a minimal sensor configuration consisting of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and RGB camera. Utilizing a DL-based object pose estimator, solely trained on synthetic data and optimized for companion board deployment, the object-relative pose measurements are fused with the IMU data to perform object-relative localization. We conduct multiple real-world experiments to validate the performance of our system for the challenging use case of power pole inspection. An example closed-loop flight is presented in the supplementary video.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fast Extrinsic Calibration for Multiple Inertial Measurement Units in Visual-Inertial System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16228v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a fast extrinsic calibration method for fusing multiple inertial measurement units (MIMU) to improve visual-inertial odometry (VIO) localization accuracy. Currently, data fusion algorithms for MIMU highly depend on the number of inertial sensors. Based on the assumption that extrinsic parameters between inertial sensors are perfectly calibrated, the fusion algorithm provides better localization accuracy with more IMUs, while neglecting the effect of extrinsic calibration error. Our method builds two non-linear least-squares problems to estimate the MIMU relative position and orientation separately, independent of external sensors and inertial noises online estimation. Then we give the general form of the virtual IMU (VIMU) method and propose its propagation on manifold. We perform our method on datasets, our self-made sensor board, and board with different IMUs, validating the superiority of our method over competing methods concerning speed, accuracy, and robustness. In the simulation experiment, we show that only fusing two IMUs with our calibration method to predict motion can rival nine IMUs. Real-world experiments demonstrate better localization accuracy of the VIO integrated with our calibration method and VIMU propagation on manifold.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment on resource-constrained devices is non-trivial since large network parameters should be accommodated in the device memory. Furthermore, these networks may risk failure post-deployment due to environmental distribution shifts at test time. In light of this, we propose UL-VIO -- an ultra-lightweight (<1M) VIO network capable of test-time adaptation (TTA) based on visual-inertial consistency. Specifically, we perform model compression to the network while preserving the low-level encoder part, including all BatchNorm parameters for resource-efficient test-time adaptation. It achieves 36X smaller network size than state-of-the-art with a minute increase in error -- 1% on the KITTI dataset. For test-time adaptation, we propose to use the inertia-referred network outputs as pseudo labels and update the BatchNorm parameter for lightweight yet effective adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to perform noise-robust TTA on VIO. Experimental results on the KITTI, EuRoC, and Marulan datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our resource-efficient adaptation method under diverse TTA scenarios with dynamic domain shifts.</p></details> |  |

A sliding window of keyframes is optimized by minimizing re-projection errors, relative inertial errors, and relative magnetometer orientation errors. The results of IMU orientation propagation are used to efficiently transform magnetometer measurements between frames producing relative orientation constraints between consecutive frames. The soft and hard iron effects are calibrated using an ellipsoid fitting algorithm. The introduction of magnetometer data results in significant reductions in the orientation error and also in recovery of the true yaw orientation with respect to the magnetic north. The proposed framework operates in all environments with slow-varying magnetic fields, mainly outdoors and underwater. We have focused our work on the underwater domain, especially in underwater caves, as the narrow passage and turbulent flow make it difficult to perform loop closures and reset the localization drift. The underwater caves present challenges to VIO due to the absence of ambient light and the confined nature of the environment, while also being a crucial source of fresh water and providing valuable historical records. Experimental results from underwater caves demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and robustness introduced by the proposed VIO extension.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the successful examples, we propose a causal visual-inertial fusion transformer (VIFT) for pose estimation in deep visual-inertial odometry. This study aims to improve pose estimation accuracy by leveraging the attention mechanisms in transformers, which better utilize historical data compared to the recurrent neural network (RNN) based methods seen in recent methods. Transformers typically require large-scale data for training. To address this issue, we utilize inductive biases for deep VIO networks. Since latent visual-inertial feature vectors encompass essential information for pose estimation, we employ transformers to refine pose estimates by updating latent vectors temporally. Our study also examines the impact of data imbalance and rotation learning methods in supervised end-to-end learning of visual inertial odometry by utilizing specialized gradients in backpropagation for the elements of SE$(3)$ group. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable and requires only a monocular camera and IMU during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that VIFT increases the accuracy of monocular VIO networks, achieving state-of-the-art results when compared to previous methods on the KITTI dataset.

Unlike its predecessor, the Mars 2020 mission, which relied on a state estimation system assuming planar terrain, MSH requires a novel approach due to the complex topography of the landing site. This work introduces a novel range-visual-inertial odometry system tailored for the unique challenges of the MSH mission. Our system extends the state-of-the-art xVIO framework by fusing consistent range information with visual and inertial measurements, preventing metric scale drift in the absence of visual-inertial excitation (mono camera and constant velocity descent), and enabling landing on any terrain structure, without requiring any planar terrain assumption. Through extensive testing in image-based simulations using actual terrain structure and textures collected in Mars orbit, we demonstrate that our range-VIO approach estimates terrain-relative velocity meeting the stringent mission requirements, and outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots (IROS), 2024</p></details> |

Also, both Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are susceptible to adverse weather conditions that causes occlusions or blur on the visual input. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for vehicle localization that uses street network based map information to correct drifting odometry estimates and intermittent GPS measurements especially, in adversarial scenarios such as driving in rain and tunnels. Specifically, our approach is a flexible fusion algorithm that integrates intermittent GPS, drifting IMU and VO estimates together with 2D map information for robust vehicle localization and tracking. We refer to our approach as Map-Fusion. We robustly evaluate our proposed approach on four geographically diverse datasets from different countries ranging across clear and rain weather conditions. These datasets also include challenging visual segments in tunnels and underpasses. We show that with the integration of the map information, our Map-Fusion algorithm reduces the error of the state-of-the-art VO and VIO approaches across all datasets. We also validate our proposed algorithm in a real-world environment and in real-time on a hardware constrained mobile robot. Map-Fusion achieved 2.46m error in clear weather and 6.05m error in rain weather for a 150m route.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR-based localization is accurate and robust to challenging environmental conditions, but 3D LiDARs are relatively heavy and require large UAV platforms, in contrast to lightweight cameras. However, visual-based self-localization methods exhibit lower accuracy and can suffer from significant drift with respect to the global reference frame. To benefit from both sensory modalities, we focus on cooperative navigation in a heterogeneous team of a primary LiDAR-equipped UAV and a secondary micro-scale camera-equipped UAV. We propose a novel cooperative approach combining LiDAR relative localization data with VIO output on board the primary UAV to obtain an accurate pose of the secondary UAV. The pose estimate is used to precisely and reliably guide the secondary UAV along trajectories defined in the primary UAV reference frame. The experimental evaluation has shown the superior accuracy of our method to the raw VIO output and demonstrated its capability to guide the secondary UAV along desired trajectories while mitigating VIO drift. Thus, such a heterogeneous system can explore large areas with LiDAR precision, as well as visit locations inaccessible to the large LiDAR-carrying UAV platforms, as was showcased in a real-world cooperative mapping scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>pre-p...</summary><p>pre-print submitted to Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems</p></details> |

Planes are commonplace in man-made environments, offering an active means to reduce drift, due to their extensive spatial and temporal observability. To make full use of planar information, we propose a novel visual-inertial odometry (VIO) using an RGBD camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), effectively integrating point and plane features in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework. Depth information of point features is leveraged to improve the accuracy of point triangulation, while plane features serve as direct observations added into the state vector. Notably, to benefit long-term navigation,a novel graph-based drift detection strategy is proposed to search overlapping and identical structures in the plane map so that the cumulative drift is suppressed subsequently. The experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and meanwhile generates a compact and consistent plane map, free of expensive global bundle adjustment and loop closing techniques.</p></details> |  |

For a drone equipped with monocular camera and an UGV equipped with LiDAR as an external sensor, we propose a robust and real-time relative pose estimation method (LVCP) based on the tight coupling of vision and LiDAR point cloud information, which does not require prior information such as maps or precise initial poses. Given that large-scale point clouds generated by 3D sensors has more accurate spatial geometric information than the feature point cloud generated by image, we utilize LiDAR point clouds to correct the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) when the camera undergoes significant shaking or the IMU has a low signal-to-noise ratio. To achieve this, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework for LiDAR-vision collaborative localization. In this framework, we construct point-plane association based on spatial geometric information, and innovatively construct a point-aided Bundle Adjustment (BA) problem as the backend to simultaneously estimate the relative pose of the camera and LiDAR and correct the VIO drift. In this process, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based sampling algorithm to complete the coarse estimation of the current camera-LiDAR pose. In this process, the initial pose of the camera used for sampling is obtained based on VIO propagation, and the valid feature-plane association number (VFPN) is used to trigger PSO-sampling process. Additionally, we propose a method that combines Structure from Motion (SFM) and multi-level sampling to initialize the algorithm, addressing the challenge of lacking initial values.</p></details> | <details><summary>See m...</summary><p>See more details in https://sites.google.com/view/lvcp</p></details> |

For parking scenarios, dynamic lighting, sparse textures, and the instability of global positioning system (GPS) signals pose challenges for most traditional localization methods. To address these difficulties, we propose VIPS-Odom, a novel semantic visual-inertial odometry framework for underground autonomous parking, which adopts tightly-coupled optimization to fuse measurements from multi-modal sensors and solves odometry. Our VIPS-Odom integrates parking slots detected from the synthesized bird-eye-view (BEV) image with traditional feature points in the frontend, and conducts tightly-coupled optimization with joint constraints introduced by measurements from the inertial measurement unit, wheel speed sensor and parking slots in the backend. We develop a multi-object tracking framework to robustly track parking slots' states.

Though modern optimization-based algorithms have achieved superior accuracy, the MSCKF-based VIO algorithms are still widely demanded for their efficient and consistent performance. As MSCKF is built upon the conventional multi-view geometry, the measured residuals are not only related to the state errors but also related to the feature position errors. To apply EKF fusion, a projection process is required to remove the feature position error from the observation model, which can lead to model and accuracy degradation. To obtain an efficient visual-inertial fusion model, while also preserving the model consistency, we propose to reconstruct the MSCKF VIO with the novel Pose-Only (PO) multi-view geometry description. In the newly constructed filter, we have modeled PO reprojection residuals, which are solely related to the motion states and thus overcome the requirements of space projection. Moreover, the new filter does not require any feature position information, which removes the computational cost and linearization errors brought in by the 3D reconstruction procedure. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, where the proposed method has shown accuracy improvements and consistent performance in challenging sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low Latency Visual Inertial Odometry with On-Sensor Accelerated Optical Flow for Resource-Constrained UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13345v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is the task of estimating the movement trajectory of an agent from an onboard camera stream fused with additional Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements. A crucial subtask within VIO is the tracking of features, which can be achieved through Optical Flow (OF). As the calculation of OF is a resource-demanding task in terms of computational load and memory footprint, which needs to be executed at low latency, especially in robotic applications, OF estimation is today performed on powerful CPUs or GPUs. This restricts its use in a broad spectrum of applications where the deployment of such powerful, power-hungry processors is unfeasible due to constraints related to cost, size, and power consumption. On-sensor hardware acceleration is a promising approach to enable low latency VIO even on resource-constrained devices such as nano drones. This paper assesses the speed-up in a VIO sensor system exploiting a compact OF sensor consisting of a global shutter camera and an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). By replacing the feature tracking logic of the VINS-Mono pipeline with data from this OF camera, we demonstrate a 49.4% reduction in latency and a 53.7% reduction of compute load of the VIO pipeline over the original VINS-Mono implementation, allowing VINS-Mono operation up to 50 FPS instead of 20 FPS on the quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor of a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Sensors Journal (JSEN)</p></details> |
| **[A Multipurpose Interface for Close- and Far-Proximity Control of Mobile Collaborative Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02171v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This letter introduces an innovative visuo-haptic interface to control Mobile Collaborative Robots (MCR). Thanks to a passive detachable mechanism, the interface can be attached/detached from a robot, offering two control modes: local control (attached) and teleoperation (detached). These modes are integrated with a robot whole-body controller and presented in a unified close- and far-proximity control framework for MCR. The earlier introduction of the haptic component in this interface enabled users to execute intricate loco-manipulation tasks via admittance-type control, effectively decoupling task dynamics and enhancing human capabilities. In contrast, this ongoing work proposes a novel design that integrates a visual component. This design utilizes Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for teleoperation, estimating the interface's pose through stereo cameras and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The estimated pose serves as the reference for the robot's end-effector in teleoperation mode. Hence, the interface offers complete flexibility and adaptability, enabling any user to operate an MCR seamlessly without needing expert knowledge. In this letter, we primarily focus on the new visual feature, and first present a performance evaluation of different VIO-based methods for teleoperation. Next, the interface's usability is analyzed in a home-care application and compared to an alternative designed by a commercial MoCap system. Results show comparable performance in terms of accuracy, completion time, and usability. Nevertheless, the proposed interface is low-cost, poses minimal wearability constraints, and can be used anywhere and anytime without needing external devices or additional equipment, offering a versatile and accessible solution for teleoperation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present ST-VIO, a novel approach which tightly fuses a single-track dynamics model for wheeled ground vehicles with visual inertial odometry (VIO). Our method calibrates and adapts the dynamics model online to improve the accuracy of forward prediction conditioned on future control inputs. The single-track dynamics model approximates wheeled vehicle motion under specific control inputs on flat ground using ordinary differential equations. We use a singularity-free and differentiable variant of the single-track model to enable seamless integration as dynamics factor into VIO and to optimize the model parameters online together with the VIO state variables. We validate our method with real-world data in both indoor and outdoor environments with different terrain types and wheels. In experiments, we demonstrate that ST-VIO can not only adapt to wheel or ground changes and improve the accuracy of prediction under new control inputs, but can even improve tracking accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive VIO: Deep Visual-Inertial Odometry with Online Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16754v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has demonstrated remarkable success due to its low-cost and complementary sensors. However, existing VIO methods lack the generalization ability to adjust to different environments and sensor attributes. In this paper, we propose Adaptive VIO, a new monocular visual-inertial odometry that combines online continual learning with traditional nonlinear optimization. Adaptive VIO comprises two networks to predict visual correspondence and IMU bias. Unlike end-to-end approaches that use networks to fuse the features from two modalities (camera and IMU) and predict poses directly, we combine neural networks with visual-inertial bundle adjustment in our VIO system. The optimized estimates will be fed back to the visual and IMU bias networks, refining the networks in a self-supervised manner. Such a learning-optimization-combined framework and feedback mechanism enable the system to perform online continual learning. Experiments demonstrate that our Adaptive VIO manifests adaptive capability on EuRoC and TUM-VI datasets. The overall performance exceeds the currently known learning-based VIO methods and is comparable to the state-of-the-art optimization-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Although in recent years, many works have been focusing on improving one of the most widely adopted state estimation methods, visual inertial odometry (VIO), by incorporating multiple cameras, these efforts predominantly address synchronous camera systems. Asynchronous cameras, which offer simpler hardware configurations and enhanced resilience, have been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, this paper presents VINS-Multi, a novel multi-camera-IMU state estimator for asynchronous cameras. The estimator comprises parallel front ends, a front end coordinator, and a back end optimization module capable of handling asynchronous input frames. It utilizes the frames effectively through a dynamic feature number allocation and a frame priority coordination strategy. The proposed estimator is integrated into a customized quadrotor platform and tested in multiple realistic and challenging scenarios to validate its practicality. Additionally, comprehensive benchmark results are provided to showcase the robustness and superior performance of the proposed estimator.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance under varying network setups, especially when combined with IMU data for real-time localization, has not been fully explored so far. In this study, we develop an error state Kalman filter (ESKF) and a pose graph optimization (PGO) approach to address this gap. We systematically evaluate the performance of the derived approaches for real-time MAV localization in realistic scenarios with 5G base stations in Line-Of-Sight (LOS), demonstrating the potential of 5G technologies in this domain. In order to experimentally test and compare our localization approaches, we augment the EuRoC MAV benchmark dataset for visual-inertial odometry with simulated yet highly realistic 5G ToA measurements. Our experimental results comprehensively assess the impact of varying network setups, including varying base station numbers and network configurations, on ToA-based MAV localization performance. The findings show promising results for seamless and robust localization using 5G ToA measurements, achieving an accuracy of 15 cm throughout the entire trajectory within a graph-based framework with five 5G base stations, and an accuracy of up to 34 cm in the case of ESKF-based localization. Additionally, we measure the run time of both algorithms and show that they are both fast enough for real-time implementation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often face a trade-off between localization accuracy and system robustness in scenarios with a high proportion of dynamic objects, point cloud distortion, and unstructured environments. To address this issue, we propose a neural descriptors-based adaptive noise filtering strategy for SLAM, named ADA-DPM, which improves the performance of localization and mapping tasks through three key technical innovations. Firstly, to tackle dynamic object interference, we design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict and filter out dynamic feature points, eliminating the ego-motion interference caused by dynamic objects. Secondly, to mitigate the impact of noise and unstructured feature points, we propose the Global Importance Scoring Head that adaptively selects high-contribution feature points while suppressing the influence of noise and unstructured feature points. Moreover, we introduce the Cross-Layer Graph Convolution Module (GLI-GCN) to construct multi-scale neighborhood graphs, fusing local structural information across different scales and improving the discriminative power of overlapping features. Finally, experimental validations on multiple public datasets confirm the effectiveness of ADA-DPM.</p></details> |  |

These challenges lead to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation. This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight, IENC-compatible format. Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly available</p></details> |  |
| **[SiLVR: Scalable Lidar-Visual Radiance Field Reconstruction with Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02657v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality reconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic texture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key contribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to evaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction. In this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual texture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be identified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM system which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is particularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain artefacts due to limited observations. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by T-RO.

One key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used, without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16 and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than 250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps.

Current SLAM benchmarks overlook the significance of repeatability (precision), despite its importance in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose a task-driven approach to SLAM benchmarking, TaskSLAM-Bench. It employs precision as a key metric, accounts for SLAM's mapping capabilities, and has easy-to-meet implementation requirements. Simulated and real-world testing scenarios of SLAM methods provide insights into the navigation performance properties of modern visual and LiDAR SLAM solutions. The outcomes show that passive stereo SLAM operates at a level of precision comparable to LiDAR SLAM in typical indoor environments. TaskSLAM-Bench complements existing benchmarks and offers richer assessment of SLAM performance in navigation-focused scenarios.

Traditional SLAM approaches, which often rely on visual or LiDAR sensors, face significant challenges in adverse conditions such as low light or featureless environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Doppler-aided radar-inertial and LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages the complementary strengths of 4D radar, FMCW LiDAR, and inertial measurement units. Our system integrates Doppler velocity measurements and spatial data into a tightly-coupled front-end and graph optimization back-end to provide enhanced ego velocity estimation, accurate odometry, and robust mapping. We also introduce a Doppler-based scan-matching technique to improve front-end odometry in dynamic environments. In addition, our framework incorporates an innovative online extrinsic calibration mechanism, utilizing Doppler velocity and loop closure to dynamically maintain sensor alignment. Extensive evaluations on both public and proprietary datasets show that our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art radar-SLAM and LiDAR-SLAM frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness.

However, two issues need to be considered when applying it in field environments: one is resource limitation, and the other is inter/intra-robot association. The resource limitation issue arises when the data size exceeds the processing capacity of the network or memory, especially when utilizing communication systems or onboard computers in the field. The inter/intra-robot association issue occurs due to the narrow convergence region of ICP under large viewpoint differences, triggering many false positive loops and ultimately resulting in an inconsistent global map for multi-robot systems. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed LiDAR SLAM framework designed for versatile field applications, called SKiD-SLAM. Extending our previous work that solely focused on lightweight place recognition and fast and robust global registration, we present a multi-robot mapping framework that focuses on robust and lightweight inter-robot loop closure in distributed LiDAR SLAM. Through various environmental experiments, we demonstrate that our method is more robust and lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art distributed SLAM approaches, overcoming resource limitation and inter/intra-robot association issues. Also, we validated the field applicability of our approach through mapping experiments in real-world planetary emulation terrain and cave environments, which are in-house datasets.

However, in geometry feature-less scenes, the accuracy is severely reduced due to lack of constraints. In this article, we propose an anti-degeneracy system based on deep learning. Firstly, we design a scale-invariant linear mapping to convert coordinates in continuous space into discrete indexes, in which a data augmentation method based on Gaussian model is proposed to ensure the model performance by effectively mitigating the impact of changes in the number of particles on the feature distribution. Secondly, we develop a degeneracy detection model using residual neural networks (ResNet) and transformer which is able to identify degeneracy by scrutinizing the distribution of the particle population. Thirdly, an adaptive anti-degeneracy strategy is designed, which first performs fusion and perturbation on the resample process to provide rich and accurate initial values for the pose optimization, and use a hierarchical pose optimization combining coarse and fine matching, which is able to adaptively adjust the optimization frequency and the sensor trustworthiness according to the degree of degeneracy, in order to enhance the ability of searching the global optimal pose. Finally, we demonstrate the optimality of the model, as well as the improvement of the image matrix method and GPU on the computation time through ablation experiments, and verify the performance of the anti-degeneracy system in different scenarios through simulation experiments and real experiments.

Incorporating semantics provides a richer scene representation that not only enhances localization accuracy in SLAM but also enables advanced cognitive functionalities for downstream navigation and planning tasks. Existing point-wise semantic LiDAR SLAM methods often suffer from poor efficiency and generalization, making them less robust in diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a semantic graph-enhanced SLAM framework, named SG-SLAM, which effectively leverages the geometric, semantic, and topological characteristics inherent in environmental structures. The semantic graph serves as a fundamental component that facilitates critical functionalities of SLAM, including robust relocalization during odometry failures, accurate loop closing, and semantic graph map construction. Our method employs a dual-threaded architecture, with one thread dedicated to online odometry and relocalization, while the other handles loop closure, pose graph optimization, and map update. This design enables our method to operate in real time and generate globally consistent semantic graph maps and point cloud maps. We extensively evaluate our method across the KITTI, MulRAN, and Apollo datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, even in modern SLAM solutions, ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned environments. Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a sensor-fusion setup afterward. In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in the literature at this scale. Specifically, this work investigates i) the effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation methods for the problem of ill-conditioned ICP in LiDAR degenerate environments, ii) the evaluation of TSVD, inequality constraints, and linear/non-linear Tikhonov regularization for the application of degenerate point cloud registration for the first time. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for least-squares minimization step of the ICP problem is carried out to better understand how each method affects the optimization and what to expect from each method. The results of the analysis are validated through multiple real-world robotic field and simulated experiments. The analysis demonstrates that active optimization degeneracy mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM, and soft-constrained methods can provide better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios with heuristic fine-tuned parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics</p></details> |

Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require extensive storage to preserve structural details in large-scale environments. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the Continuous and Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) introduced in [1]. Our proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps capable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's spherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency after loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR odometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique optimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle Adjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction. Experimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D mapping quality and competitive LiDAR trajectory accuracy, delivering sensor-rate real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU. We will release the CURL-SLAM implementation to the community.</p></details> |  |

While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, preprint, submitted to Robotics And Autonomous Systems</p></details> |
| **[KISS-SLAM: A Simple, Robust, and Accurate 3D LiDAR SLAM System With Enhanced Generalization Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12660v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate localization and mapping of an environment using laser scanners, so-called LiDAR SLAM, is essential to many robotic applications. Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, the measurement process is demanding, requiring up to two days per hectare for data collection, significant data storage, as well as resource-heavy post-processing of 3D data. In this work, we present a real-time mapping and analysis system that enables online generation of forest inventories using mobile laser scanners that can be mounted e.g. on mobile robots. Given incrementally created and locally accurate submaps-data payloads-our approach extracts tree candidates using a custom, Voronoi-inspired clustering algorithm. Tree candidates are reconstructed using an adapted Hough algorithm, which enables robust modeling of the tree stem. Further, we explicitly incorporate the incremental nature of the data collection by consistently updating the database using a pose graph LiDAR SLAM system. This enables us to refine our estimates of the tree traits if an area is revisited later during a mission. We demonstrate competitive accuracy to TLS or manual measurements using laser scanners that we mounted on backpacks or mobile robots operating in conifer, broad-leaf and mixed forests. Our results achieve RMSE of 1.93 cm, a bias of 0.65 cm and a standard deviation of 1.81 cm (averaged across these sequences)-with no post-processing required after the mission is complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency for Large-Scale SLAM: A Minimal Subset Approach for Scalable Loop Closures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01791v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical LiDAR SLAM architectures feature a front-end for odometry estimation and a back-end for refining and optimizing the trajectory and map, commonly through loop closures. However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. In sum, evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables.

| **[LiDAR Loop Closure Detection using Semantic Graphs with Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19382v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong 3D Mapping Framework for Hand-held & Robot-mounted LiDAR Mapping Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18110v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a lifelong 3D mapping framework that is modular, cloud-native by design and more importantly, works for both hand-held and robot-mounted 3D LiDAR mapping systems. Our proposed framework comprises of dynamic point removal, multi-session map alignment, map change detection and map version control. First, our sensor-setup agnostic dynamic point removal algorithm works seamlessly with both hand-held and robot-mounted setups to produce clean static 3D maps. Second, the multi-session map alignment aligns these clean static maps automatically, without manual parameter fine-tuning, into a single reference frame, using a two stage approach based on feature descriptor matching and fine registration. Third, our novel map change detection identifies positive and negative changes between two aligned maps. Finally, the map version control maintains a single base map that represents the current state of the environment, and stores the detected positive and negative changes, and boundary information. Our unique map version control system can reconstruct any of the previous clean session maps and allows users to query changes between any two random mapping sessions, all without storing any input raw session maps, making it very unique. Extensive experiments are performed using hand-held commercial LiDAR mapping devices and open-source robot-mounted LiDAR SLAM algorithms to evaluate each module and the whole 3D lifelong mapping framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Few-shot Crack Segmentation and its Precise 3D Automatic Measurement in Concrete Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09203v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Spatial Systems has become increasingly essential in concrete crack inspection. However, existing methods often lacks adaptability to diverse scenarios, exhibits limited robustness in image-based approaches, and struggles with curved or complex geometries. To address these limitations, an innovative framework for two-dimensional (2D) crack detection, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, and 3D automatic crack measurement was proposed by integrating computer vision technologies and multi-modal Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in this study. Firstly, building on a base DeepLabv3+ segmentation model, and incorporating specific refinements utilizing foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM), we developed a crack segmentation method with strong generalization across unfamiliar scenarios, enabling the generation of precise 2D crack masks. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of 3D reconstruction, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds were utilized together with image data and segmentation masks. By leveraging both image- and LiDAR-SLAM, we developed a multi-frame and multi-modal fusion framework that produces dense, colorized point clouds, effectively capturing crack semantics at a 3D real-world scale. Furthermore, the crack geometric attributions were measured automatically and directly within 3D dense point cloud space, surpassing the limitations of conventional 2D image-based measurements. This advancement makes the method suitable for structural components with curved and complex 3D geometries. Experimental results across various concrete structures highlight the significant improvements and unique advantages of the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROLO-SLAM: Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only SLAM in Uneven Terrain with Ground Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02166v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based SLAM is recognized as one effective method to offer localization guidance in rough environments. However, off-the-shelf LiDAR-based SLAM methods suffer from significant pose estimation drifts, particularly components relevant to the vertical direction, when passing to uneven terrains. This deficiency typically leads to a conspicuously distorted global map. In this article, a LiDAR-based SLAM method is presented to improve the accuracy of pose estimations for ground vehicles in rough terrains, which is termed Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only (ROLO) SLAM. The method exploits a forward location prediction to coarsely eliminate the location difference of consecutive scans, thereby enabling separate and accurate determination of the location and orientation at the front-end. Furthermore, we adopt a parallel-capable spatial voxelization for correspondence-matching. We develop a spherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate the rotation of vehicle. By incorporating geometric alignment, we introduce the motion constraint into the optimization formulation to enhance the rapid and effective estimation of LiDAR's translation. Subsequently, we extract several keyframes to construct the submap and exploit an alignment from the current scan to the submap for precise pose estimation. Meanwhile, a global-scale factor graph is established to aid in the reduction of cumulative errors. In various scenes, diverse experiments have been conducted to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM excels in pose estimation of ground vehicles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by Journal of Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Selective Kalman Filter: When and How to Fuse Multi-Sensor Information to Overcome Degeneracy in SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17235v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research trends in SLAM systems are now focusing more on multi-sensor fusion to handle challenging and degenerative environments. However, most existing multi-sensor fusion SLAM methods mainly use all of the data from a range of sensors, a strategy we refer to as the all-in method. This method, while merging the benefits of different sensors, also brings in their weaknesses, lowering the robustness and accuracy and leading to high computational demands. To address this, we propose a new fusion approach -- Selective Kalman Filter -- to carefully choose and fuse information from multiple sensors (using LiDAR and visual observations as examples in this paper). For deciding when to fuse data, we implement degeneracy detection in LiDAR SLAM, incorporating visual measurements only when LiDAR SLAM exhibits degeneracy. Regarding degeneracy detection, we propose an elegant yet straightforward approach to determine the degeneracy of LiDAR SLAM and to identify the specific degenerative direction. This method fully considers the coupled relationship between rotational and translational constraints. In terms of how to fuse data, we use visual measurements only to update the specific degenerative states. As a result, our proposed method improves upon the all-in method by greatly enhancing real-time performance due to less processing visual data, and it introduces fewer errors from visual measurements. Experiments demonstrate that our method for degeneracy detection and fusion, in addressing degeneracy issues, exhibits higher precision and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers enhanced real-time performance relative to the all-in method. The code is openly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Real-time Degeneracy Sensing and Compensation Method for Enhanced LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07513v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01041v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGLC: Semantic Graph-Guided Coarse-Fine-Refine Full Loop Closing for LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08106v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closing is a crucial component in SLAM that helps eliminate accumulated errors through two main steps: loop detection and loop pose correction. The first step determines whether loop closing should be performed, while the second estimates the 6-DoF pose to correct odometry drift. Current methods mostly focus on developing robust descriptors for loop closure detection, often neglecting loop pose estimation. A few methods that do include pose estimation either suffer from low accuracy or incur high computational costs. To tackle this problem, we introduce SGLC, a real-time semantic graph-guided full loop closing method, with robust loop closure detection and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. SGLC takes into account the distinct characteristics of foreground and background points. For foreground instances, it builds a semantic graph that not only abstracts point cloud representation for fast descriptor generation and matching but also guides the subsequent loop verification and initial pose estimation. Background points, meanwhile, are exploited to provide more geometric features for scan-wise descriptor construction and stable planar information for further pose refinement. Loop pose estimation employs a \mbox{coarse-fine-refine} registration scheme that considers the alignment of both instance points and background points, offering high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we integrate SGLC into a SLAM system, eliminating accumulated errors and improving overall SLAM performance. The implementation of SGLC will be released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SGLC.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, for long duration missions, existing works that either operate directly the full pointclouds or on extracted features face key tradeoffs in accuracy and computational efficiency (e.g., memory consumption). To address these issues, this paper presents DFLIOM with several key innovations. Unlike previous methods that rely on handcrafted heuristics and hand-tuned parameters for feature extraction, we propose a learning-based approach that select points relevant to LiDAR SLAM pointcloud registration. Furthermore, we extend our prior work DLIOM with the learned feature extractor and observe our method enables similar or even better localization performance using only about 20\% of the points in the dense point clouds. We demonstrate that DFLIOM performs well on multiple public benchmarks, achieving a 2.4\% decrease in localization error and 57.5\% decrease in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods (DLIOM). Although extracting features with the proposed network requires extra time, it is offset by the faster processing time downstream, thus maintaining real-time performance using 20Hz LiDAR on our hardware setup. The effectiveness of our learning-based feature extraction module is further demonstrated through comparison with several handcrafted feature extractors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

GEODE comprises 64 trajectories spanning over 64 kilometers across seven diverse settings with varying degrees of degeneracy. The data was meticulously collected to promote the development of versatile algorithms by incorporating various LiDAR sensors, stereo cameras, IMUs, and diverse motion conditions.

In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU. Codes will be available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PIN_SLAM.</p></details> | 20 pages |

However, the utilization of 2D LiDAR in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) frequently encounters challenges related to motion degeneracy, particularly in geometrically similar environments. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust, accurate, and multi-sensor-fused 2D LiDAR SLAM system specifically designed for indoor mobile robots. To commence, the original LiDAR data undergoes meticulous processing through point and line extraction. Leveraging the distinctive characteristics of indoor environments, line-line constraints are established to complement other sensor data effectively, thereby augmenting the overall robustness and precision of the system. Concurrently, a tightly-coupled front-end is created, integrating data from the 2D LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry, thus enabling real-time state estimation. Building upon this solid foundation, a novel global feature point matching-based loop closure detection algorithm is proposed. This algorithm proves highly effective in mitigating front-end accumulated errors and ultimately constructs a globally consistent map. The experimental results indicate that our system fully meets real-time requirements. When compared to Cartographer, our system not only exhibits lower trajectory errors but also demonstrates stronger robustness, particularly in degeneracy problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Measurement Science and Technology: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ad3ea3/meta</p></details> |

Existing implicit mapping methods for LiDAR show promising results in large-scale reconstruction, but either require groundtruth poses or run slower than real-time. In contrast, LONER uses LiDAR data to train an MLP to estimate a dense map in real-time, while simultaneously estimating the trajectory of the sensor. To achieve real-time performance, this paper proposes a novel information-theoretic loss function that accounts for the fact that different regions of the map may be learned to varying degrees throughout online training. The proposed method is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on two open-source datasets. This evaluation illustrates that the proposed loss function converges faster and leads to more accurate geometry reconstruction than other loss functions used in depth-supervised neural implicit frameworks. Finally, this paper shows that LONER estimates trajectories competitively with state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM methods, while also producing dense maps competitive with existing real-time implicit mapping methods that use groundtruth poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors equally contributed.

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |

However, there are two issues that degrade the performance of global registration in LiDAR SLAM: one is the sparsity issue and the other is degeneracy. The sparsity issue is caused by the sparse characteristics of the 3D point cloud measurements in a mechanically spinning LiDAR sensor. The degeneracy issue sometimes occurs because the outlier-rejection methods reject too many correspondences, leaving less than three inliers. These two issues have become more severe as the pose discrepancy between the two viewpoints of 3D point clouds becomes greater. To tackle these problems, we propose a robust global registration framework, called \textit{Quatro++}. Extending our previous work that solely focused on the global registration itself, we address the robust global registration in terms of the loop closing in LiDAR SLAM. To this end, ground segmentation is exploited to achieve robust global registration. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method shows a higher success rate than the state-of-the-art global registration methods, overcoming the sparsity and degeneracy issues. In addition, we show that ground segmentation significantly helps to increase the success rate for the ground vehicles. Finally, we apply our proposed method to the loop closing module in LiDAR SLAM and confirm that the quality of the loop constraints is improved, showing more precise mapping results. Therefore, the experimental evidence corroborated the suitability of our method as an initial alignment in the loop closing. Our code is available at https://quatro-plusplus.github.io.</p></details> | 26 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Versatile LiDAR-Inertial Odometry With SE (2) Constraints for Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01584v1)** | 2023-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR SLAM has become one of the major localization systems for ground vehicles since LiDAR Odometry And Mapping (LOAM). Many extension works on LOAM mainly leverage one specific constraint to improve the performance, e.g., information from on-board sensors such as loop closure and inertial state; prior conditions such as ground level and motion dynamics. In many robotic applications, these conditions are often known partially, hence a SLAM system can be a comprehensive problem due to the existence of numerous constraints. Therefore, we can achieve a better SLAM result by fusing them properly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages both the on-board perception system and prior information such as motion dynamics to improve localization performance. In particular, we consider the case for ground vehicles, which are commonly used for autonomous driving and warehouse logistics. We present a computationally efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry method that directly parameterizes ground vehicle poses on SE(2). The out-of-SE(2) motion perturbations are not neglected but incorporated into an integrated noise term of a novel SE(2)-constraints model. For odometric measurement processing, we propose a versatile, tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve better pose estimation than traditional LiDAR odometry. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate our proposed method's performance in different scenarios, including localization for both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches either rely on dense point clouds to achieve high localization accuracy or use generalized descriptors to reduce map size. Unfortunately, these two aspects seem to conflict with each other. To address this limitation, we propose a unified architecture, DeepPointMap, achieving excellent preference on both aspects. We utilize neural network to extract highly representative and sparse neural descriptors from point clouds, enabling memory-efficient map representation and accurate multi-scale localization tasks (e.g., odometry and loop-closure). Moreover, we showcase the versatility of our framework by extending it to more challenging multi-agent collaborative SLAM. The promising results obtained in these scenarios further emphasize the effectiveness and potential of our approach.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes, ECMD, an event-centric multisensory dataset containing 81 sequences and covering over 200 km of various challenging driving scenarios including high-speed motion, repetitive scenarios, dynamic objects, etc. ECMD provides data from two sets of stereo event cameras with different resolutions (640*480, 346*260), stereo industrial cameras, an infrared camera, a top-installed mechanical LiDAR with two slanted LiDARs, two consumer-level GNSS receivers, and an onboard IMU. Meanwhile, the ground-truth of the vehicle was obtained using a centimeter-level high-accuracy GNSS-RTK/INS navigation system. All sensors are well-calibrated and temporally synchronized at the hardware level, with recording data simultaneously. We additionally evaluate several state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for benchmarking visual and LiDAR SLAM and identifying their limitations.

This article begins by formulating loop closing and relocalization within a unified framework. Then, we propose a novel multi-head network LCR-Net to tackle both tasks effectively. It exploits novel feature extraction and pose-aware attention mechanism to precisely estimate similarities and 6-DoF poses between pairs of LiDAR scans. In the end, we integrate our LCR-Net into a SLAM system and achieve robust and accurate online LiDAR SLAM in outdoor driving environments. We thoroughly evaluate our LCR-Net through three setups derived from loop closing and relocalization, including candidate retrieval, closed-loop point cloud registration, and continuous relocalization using multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that LCR-Net excels in all three tasks, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and exhibiting a remarkable generalization ability. Notably, our LCR-Net outperforms baseline methods without using a time-consuming robust pose estimator, rendering it suitable for online SLAM applications. To our best knowledge, the integration of LCR-Net yields the first LiDAR SLAM with the capability of deep loop closing and relocalization. The implementation of our methods will be made open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages 10 figures 7 tables</p></details> |

This new capability is beneficial for perceptions in various use cases, but it is challenging for resource-constrained mobile devices to use the perceptions in real-time because of their high computational complexity. In this context, edge computing can be used to enable LiDAR online perceptions, but offloading the perceptions on the edge server requires a low-latency, lightweight, and efficient compression due to the large volume of LiDAR point clouds data. This paper presents FLiCR, a fast and lightweight LiDAR point cloud compression method for enabling edge-assisted online perceptions. FLiCR is based on range images (RI) as an intermediate representation (IR), and dictionary coding for compressing RIs. FLiCR achieves its benefits by leveraging lossy RIs, and we show the efficiency of bytestream compression is largely improved with quantization and subsampling. In addition, we identify the limitation of current quality metrics for presenting the entropy of a point cloud, and introduce a new metric that reflects both point-wise and entropy-wise qualities for lossy IRs. The evaluation results show FLiCR is more suitable for edge-assisted real-time perceptions than the existing LiDAR compressions, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our compression and metric with the evaluations on 3D object detection and LiDAR SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

DLIOM contains several key algorithmic innovations in both the front-end and back-end subsystems to design a resilient LiDAR-inertial architecture that is perceptive to the environment and produces accurate localization and high-fidelity 3D mapping for autonomous robotic platforms. Our ideas spawned after a deep investigation into modern LiDAR SLAM systems and their inabilities to generalize across different operating environments, in which we address several common algorithmic failure points by means of proactive safe-guards to provide long-term operational reliability in the unstructured real world. We detail several important innovations to localization accuracy and mapping resiliency distributed throughout a typical LiDAR SLAM pipeline to comprehensively increase algorithmic speed, accuracy, and robustness. In addition, we discuss insights gained from our ground-up approach while implementing such a complex system for real-time state estimation on resource-constrained systems, and we experimentally show the increased performance of our method as compared to the current state-of-the-art on both public benchmark and self-collected datasets.</p></details> |  |

Extending our previous approach CFEAR, we present an in-depth investigation on a wider range of data sets, quantifying the importance of filtering, resolution, registration cost and loss functions, keyframe history, and motion compensation. We present a new solving strategy and configuration that overcomes previous issues with sparsity and bias, and improves our state-of-the-art by 38%, thus, surprisingly, outperforming radar SLAM and approaching lidar SLAM.

However, it faces many challenges in real-world scenarios, such as the prior information about the environment being absent and poor communication among the team members. This work presents DCL-SLAM, a fully distributed collaborative LiDAR SLAM framework intended for the robotic swarm to simultaneously co-localize in an unknown environment with minimal information exchange. Based on ad-hoc wireless peer-to-peer communication (limited bandwidth and communication range), DCL-SLAM adopts the lightweight LiDAR-Iris descriptor for place recognition and does not require full connectivity among teams. DCL-SLAM includes three main parts: a replaceable single-robot front-end that produces LiDAR odometry results; a distributed loop closure module that detects inter-robot loop closures with keyframes; and a distributed back-end module that adapts distributed pose graph optimizer combined with a pairwise consistent measurement set maximization algorithm to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures. We integrate our proposed framework with diverse open-source LiDAR odometry methods to show its versatility. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on benchmarking datasets and field experiments over various scales and environments. Experimental result shows that DCL-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and lower communication bandwidth than other state-of-art multi-robot SLAM systems.

| **[Marker-based Visual SLAM leveraging Hierarchical Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01155v2)** | 2023-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fiducial markers can encode rich information about the environment and can aid Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approaches in reconstructing maps with practical semantic information. Current marker-based VSLAM approaches mainly utilize markers for improving feature detections in low-feature environments and/or for incorporating loop closure constraints, generating only low-level geometric maps of the environment prone to inaccuracies in complex environments. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a VSLAM approach utilizing a monocular camera along with fiducial markers to generate hierarchical representations of the environment while improving the camera pose estimate. The proposed approach detects semantic entities from the surroundings, including walls, corridors, and rooms encoded within markers, and appropriately adds topological constraints among them. Experimental results on a real-world dataset collected with a robot demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a traditional marker-based VSLAM baseline in terms of accuracy, given the addition of new constraints while creating enhanced map representations. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory results when comparing the reconstructed map quality to the one reconstructed using a LiDAR SLAM approach.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Dense maps are essential for robotic applications, such as map-based navigation. Due to the low memory cost, mesh has become an attractive dense model for mapping in recent years. However, existing methods usually produce mesh maps by using an offline post-processing step to generate mesh maps. This two-step pipeline does not allow these methods to use the built mesh maps online and to enable localization and meshing to benefit each other. To solve this problem, we propose the first CPU-only real-time LiDAR SLAM system that can simultaneously build a mesh map and perform localization against the mesh map. A novel and direct meshing strategy with Gaussian process reconstruction realizes the fast building, registration, and updating of mesh maps. We perform experiments on several public datasets. The results show that our SLAM system can run at around $40$Hz. The localization and meshing accuracy also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the TSDF map and Poisson reconstruction.

We demonstrate by experiments that the accuracy and robustness of the LiDAR SLAM system are both improved. Finally, we have done systematic experimental tests at the Hong Kong science park as well as other indoor or outdoor real complicated testing circumstances, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. It is demonstrated that our system has high accuracy, robustness, as well as efficiency.

From our experiments, we find that current LiDAR SLAM systems have limited performance when the noise level in the obtained point clouds is large. Therefore, in this work, we propose a general framework to tackle the problem of denoising and loop closure for LiDAR SLAM in complex environments with many noises and outliers caused by reflective materials. Current approaches for point clouds denoising are mainly designed for small-scale point clouds and can not be extended to large-scale point clouds scenes. In this work, we firstly proposed a lightweight network for large-scale point clouds denoising. Subsequently, we have also designed an efficient loop closure network for place recognition in global optimization to improve the localization accuracy of the whole system. Finally, we have demonstrated by extensive experiments and benchmark studies that our method can have a significant boost on the localization accuracy of the LiDAR SLAM system when faced with noisy point clouds, with a marginal increase in computational cost.</p></details> | IROS 2022 |

The solutions to these problems are generally based on their respective assumptions, \ie{the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based object association method that accurately associates objects according to the historical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the stationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently restored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words (BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop searching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However, for 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively recognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop pose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. Our method not only efficiently recognizes the revisited loop places, but also corrects the full 6-DoF loop pose in real time. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D LiDAR feature LinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate point-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR odometry system to evaluate loop closing performance. We test our method on public dataset, and compare it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. BoW3D shows better performance in terms of F1 max and extended precision scores on most scenarios. It is noticeable that BoW3D takes an average of 48 ms to recognize and correct the loops on KITTI 00 (includes 4K+ 64-ray LiDAR scans), when executed on a notebook with an Intel Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor.

This is in part owing to the high-accuracy of robust SLAM algorithms and the emergence of new and lower-cost lidar products. This study benchmarks current state-of-the-art lidar SLAM algorithms with a multi-modal lidar sensor setup showcasing diverse scanning modalities (spinning and solid-state) and sensing technologies, and lidar cameras, mounted on a mobile sensing and computing platform. We extend our previous multi-modal multi-lidar dataset with additional sequences and new sources of ground truth data. Specifically, we propose a new multi-modal multi-lidar SLAM-assisted and ICP-based sensor fusion method for generating ground truth maps. With these maps, we then match real-time pointcloud data using a natural distribution transform (NDT) method to obtain the ground truth with full 6 DOF pose estimation. This novel ground truth data leverages high-resolution spinning and solid-state lidars. We also include new open road sequences with GNSS-RTK data and additional indoor sequences with motion capture (MOCAP) ground truth, complementing the previous forest sequences with MOCAP data. We perform an analysis of the positioning accuracy achieved with ten different SLAM algorithm and lidar combinations. We also report the resource utilization in four different computational platforms and a total of five settings (Intel and Jetson ARM CPUs). Our experimental results show that current state-of-the-art lidar SLAM algorithms perform very differently for different types of sensors.

For integration with motion planning, it is desirable for SLAM pipelines to generate lightweight geometric map representations. Such representations are also particularly well-suited for man-made environments, which can often be viewed as a so-called "Manhattan world" built on a Cartesian grid. In this work we present a 3D LiDAR SLAM algorithm for Manhattan world environments which extracts planar features from point clouds to achieve lightweight, real-time localization and mapping. Our approach generates plane-based maps which occupy significantly less memory than their point cloud equivalents, and are suited towards fast collision checking for motion planning. By leveraging the Manhattan world assumption, we target extraction of orthogonal planes to generate maps which are more structured and organized than those of existing plane-based LiDAR SLAM approaches. We demonstrate our approach in the high-fidelity AirSim simulator and in real-world experiments with a ground rover equipped with a Velodyne LiDAR. For both cases, we are able to generate high quality maps and trajectory estimates at a rate matching the sensor rate of 10 Hz.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMBAO: A Landmark Map for Bundle Adjustment Odometry in LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08810v1)** | 2022-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry is one of the essential parts of LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, existing LiDAR odometry tends to match a new scan simply iteratively with previous fixed-pose scans, gradually accumulating errors. Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism, bundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry due to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore, this letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment odometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based odometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for a more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors. Specifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of just their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks according to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced, and marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but corresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the computation and improving the real-time properties. In addition, experiments on three challenging datasets show that our algorithm achieves real-time performance in outdoor driving and outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM algorithms, including Lego-LOAM and VLOM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

While most of these SLAM systems use Visual and LiDAR sensors in tandem with an odometry sensor, these odometry sensors drift over time. To combat this drift, Visual SLAM systems deploy compute and memory intensive search algorithms to detect `Loop Closures', which make the trajectory estimate globally consistent. To circumvent these resource (compute and memory) intensive algorithms, we present ViWiD, which integrates WiFi and Visual sensors in a dual-layered system. This dual-layered approach separates the tasks of local and global trajectory estimation making ViWiD resource efficient while achieving on-par or better performance to state-of-the-art Visual SLAM. We demonstrate ViWiD's performance on four datasets, covering over 1500 m of traversed path and show 4.3x and 4x reduction in compute and memory consumption respectively compared to state-of-the-art Visual and Lidar SLAM systems with on par SLAM performance.</p></details> |  |

We propose a scheme that fuses map prior and vanishing points from images, which can establish an energy term that is only constrained on rotation, called the direction projection error. Then we embed these direction priors into a visual-LiDAR SLAM system that integrates camera and LiDAR measurements in a tightly-coupled way at backend. Specifically, our method generates visual reprojection error and point to Implicit Moving Least Square(IMLS) surface of scan constraints, and solves them jointly along with direction projection error at global optimization. Experiments on KITTI, KITTI-360 and Oxford Radar Robotcar show that we achieve lower localization error or Absolute Pose Error (APE) than prior map, which validates our method is effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages (including supplementary material), accepted by PRCV 2022</p></details> |
| **[Lidar SLAM for Autonomous Driving Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11855v1)** | 2022-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Lidar-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for autonomous driving vehicles. Fusing data from landmark sensors and a strap-down Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in an adaptive Kalman filter (KF) plus the observability of the system are investigated. In addition to the vehicle's states and landmark positions, a self-tuning filter estimates the IMU calibration parameters as well as the covariance of the measurement noise. The discrete-time covariance matrix of the process noise, the state transition matrix, and the observation sensitivity matrix are derived in closed-form making them suitable for real-time implementation. Examining the observability of the 3D SLAM system leads to the conclusion that the system remains observable upon a geometrical condition on the alignment of the landmarks.</p></details> |  |

Etna, Sicily, an environment analogous to the Moon and Mars, using a hand-held sensor suite with attributes suitable for implementation on a space-like mobile rover. The environment is characterized by challenging conditions regarding both the visual and structural appearance: severe visual aliasing poses significant limitations to the ability of visual SLAM systems to perform place recognition, while the absence of outstanding structural details, joined with the limited Field-of-View of the utilized Solid-State LiDAR sensor, challenges traditional LiDAR SLAM for the task of pose estimation using point clouds alone. With this data, that covers more than 4 kilometers of travel on soft volcanic slopes, we aim to: 1) provide a tool to expose limitations of state-of-the-art SLAM systems with respect to environments, which are not present in widely available datasets and 2) motivate the development of novel localization and mapping approaches, that rely efficiently on the complementary capabilities of the two sensors.

The dataset includes data from two commercially available devices - a stereoscopic-inertial camera and a multi-beam 3D LiDAR, which also provides inertial measurements. Additionally, we used a tripod-mounted survey grade LiDAR scanner to capture a detailed millimeter-accurate 3D map of the test location (containing $\sim$290 million points). Using the map we inferred centimeter-accurate 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) ground truth for the position of the device for each LiDAR scan to enable better evaluation of LiDAR and vision localisation, mapping and reconstruction systems. This ground truth is the particular novel contribution of this dataset and we believe that it will enable systematic evaluation which many similar datasets have lacked. The dataset combines both built environments, open spaces and vegetated areas so as to test localization and mapping systems such as vision-based navigation, visual and LiDAR SLAM, 3D LIDAR reconstruction and appearance-based place recognition.

However, most of the current lidar SLAM approaches are based on the assumption of a static environment. Hence the localization in a dynamic environment with multiple moving objects is actually unreliable. The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively. RF-LIO is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

However, LiDARs do not perform well in geometrically-degraded environments, due to the challenge of loop closure detection and computational load to perform scan matching. Existing WiFi infrastructure can be exploited for localization and mapping with low hardware and computational cost. Yet, accurate pose estimation using WiFi is challenging as different signal values can be measured at the same location due to the unpredictability of signal propagation. Therefore, we introduce the use of WiFi fingerprint sequence for pose estimation (i.e. loop closure) in SLAM. This approach exploits the spatial coherence of location fingerprints obtained while a mobile robot is moving. This has better capability of correcting odometry drift. The method also incorporates LiDAR scans and thus, improving computational efficiency for large and geometrically-degraded environments while maintaining the accuracy of LiDAR SLAM. We conducted experiments in an indoor environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. The results are evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and it has achieved an accuracy of 0.88m for the test environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the 2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)</p></details> |

In particular, ground-optimized LiDAR odometry usually employs ground segmentation as a preprocessing method. This is because most of the points in a 3D point cloud captured by a 3D LiDAR sensor on a terrestrial platform are from the ground. However, the effect of the performance of ground segmentation on LiDAR odometry is still not closely examined. In this paper, a robust ground-optimized LiDAR odometry framework is proposed to facilitate the study to check the effect of ground segmentation on LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. By using our proposed odometry framework, it is easy and straightforward to test whether ground segmentation algorithms help extract well-described features and thus improve SLAM performance. In addition, by leveraging the SOTA ground segmentation method called Patchwork, which shows robust ground segmentation even in complex and uneven urban environments with little performance perturbation, a novel ground-optimized LiDAR odometry is proposed, called PaGO-LOAM. The methods were tested using the KITTI odometry dataset. \textit{PaGO-LOAM} shows robust and accurate performance compared with the baseline method.

However, place recognition and geometric verification using these landmarks is challenging due to the requirement for global matching without an initial guess. Existing works typically only leverage either pole or plane landmarks, limiting application to a restricted set of environments. We present a global data association method for loop closure in lidar scans using 3D line and plane objects simultaneously and in a unified manner. The main novelty of this paper is in the representation of line and plane objects extracted from lidar scans on the manifold of affine subspaces, known as the affine Grassmannian. Line and plane correspondences are matched using our graph-based data association framework and subsequently registered in the least-squares sense. Compared to pole-only approaches and plane-only approaches, our 3D affine Grassmannian method yields a 71% and 325% increase respectively to loop closure recall at 100% precision on the KITTI dataset and can provide frame alignment with less than 10 cm and 1 deg of error.</p></details> |  |

Removing dynamic object is crucial in this situation but become tricky when ego-motion is coupled. In this paper, instead of proposing a new slam framework, we aim at a more general strategy for a localization scenario. In that case, Dynamic Registration is available for integrating with any lidar slam system. We utilize 3D object detection to obtain potential moving objects and remove them temporarily. Then we proposed Dynamic Registration, to iteratively estimate ego-motion and segment moving objects until no static object generates. Static objects are merged with the environment. Finally, we successfully segment dynamic objects, static environments with static objects, and ego-motion estimation in a dynamic environment. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method on KITTI Tracking datasets. Results show stable and consistent improvements based on other classical registration algorithms.</p></details> | submit to IV 2022 |

However, its mapping procedure is usually operated by a joystick in static environments, while indoor environments often are dynamic with moving objects such as people. The generated map with noisy points due to the dynamic objects is usually incomplete and distorted. To address this problem, we propose a framework of 2D-LiDAR-based SLAM without manual control that effectively excludes dynamic objects (people) and simplify the process for a robot to map an environment. The framework, which includes three parts: people tracking, filtering and following. We verify our proposed framework in experiments with two classic 2D-LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms in indoor environments. The results show that this framework is effective in handling dynamic objects and reducing the mapping error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)</p></details> |

The high-rate inertial data complement the other lower-rate modalities. Moreover, in the absence of constant acceleration, the gravity vector makes two attitude angles out of three observable in the global coordinate frame. In visual odometry, this is already being used to reduce the 6-Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) pose estimation problem to 4-DOF. In lidar SLAM, the gravity measurements are often used as a penalty in the back-end global map optimization to prevent map deformations. In this work, we propose an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based front-end which exploits the observable DOF and provides pose estimates aligned with the gravity vector. We believe that this front-end has the potential to support the loop closure identification, thus speeding up convergences of global map optimizations. The presented approach has been extensively tested in large-scale outdoor environments as well as in the Subterranean Challenge organized by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). We show that it can reduce the localization drift by 30% when compared to the standard 6-DOF ICP. Moreover, the code is readily available to the community as a part of the libpointmatcher library.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[DL-SLOT: Dynamic Lidar SLAM and Object Tracking Based On Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11431v1)** | 2022-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two key issues in an autonomous driving system. Two assumptions are often made for them, i.e. the static world assumption of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the exact ego-pose assumption of object tracking, respectively. However, these assumptions are difficult to hold in highly dynamic road scenarios where SLAM and object tracking become correlated and mutually beneficial. In this paper, DL-SLOT, a dynamic Lidar SLAM and object tracking method is proposed. This method integrates the state estimations of both the ego vehicle and the static and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework, to realize SLAM and object tracking (SLOT) simultaneously. Firstly, we implement object detection to remove all the points that belong to potential dynamic objects. Then, LiDAR odometry is conducted using the filtered point cloud. At the same time, detected objects are associated with the history object trajectories based on the time-series information in a sliding window. The states of the static and dynamic objects and ego vehicle in the sliding window are integrated into a unified local optimization framework. We perform SLAM and object tracking simultaneously in this framework, which significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM in highly dynamic road scenarios and the accuracy of objects' states estimation. Experiments on public datasets have shown that our method achieves better accuracy than A-LOAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[LCDNet: Deep Loop Closure Detection and Point Cloud Registration for LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05056v4)** | 2022-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is an essential component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems, which reduces the drift accumulated over time. Over the years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this task, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted techniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we introduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR point clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and estimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the map. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that extracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the transformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose head based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a differentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations of LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud registration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with reverse loops. Moreover, we integrate our proposed loop closure detection approach into a LiDAR SLAM library to provide a complete mapping system and demonstrate the generalization ability using different sensor setup in an unseen city.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2022</p></details> |
| **[SC-LiDAR-SLAM: a Front-end Agnostic Versatile LiDAR SLAM System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06423v1)** | 2022-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D point cloud map generation is a core task for various robot missions or even for data-driven urban analysis. To do so, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology have been elaborated. To compose a full SLAM system, many odometry and place recognition methods have independently been proposed in academia. However, they have hardly been integrated or too tightly combined so that exchanging (upgrading) either single odometry or place recognition module is very effort demanding. Recently, the performance of each module has been improved a lot, so it is necessary to build a SLAM system that can effectively integrate them and easily replace them with the latest one. In this paper, we release such a front-end agnostic LiDAR SLAM system, named SC-LiDAR-SLAM. We built a complete SLAM system by designing it modular, and successfully integrating it with Scan Context++ and diverse existing opensource LiDAR odometry methods to generate an accurate point cloud map</p></details> |  |
| **[A Universal LiDAR SLAM Accelerator System on Low-cost FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09523v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) serves as a basis for indoor cleaning, navigation, and many other useful applications in both industry and household. From a series of LiDAR scans, it constructs an accurate, globally consistent model of the environment and estimates a robot position inside it. SLAM is inherently computationally intensive; it is a challenging problem to realize a fast and reliable SLAM system on mobile robots with a limited processing capability. To overcome such hurdles, in this paper, we propose a universal, low-power, and resource-efficient accelerator design for 2D LiDAR SLAM targeting resource-limited FPGAs. As scan matching is at the heart of SLAM, the proposed accelerator consists of dedicated scan matching cores on the programmable logic part, and provides software interfaces to facilitate the use. Our accelerator can be integrated to various SLAM methods including the ROS (Robot Operating System)-based ones, and users can switch to a different method without modifying and re-synthesizing the logic part. We integrate the accelerator into three widely-used methods, i.e., scan matching, particle filter, and graph-based SLAM. We evaluate the design in terms of resource utilization, speed, and quality of output results using real-world datasets. Experiment results on a Pynq-Z2 board demonstrate that our design accelerates scan matching and loop-closure detection tasks by up to 14.84x and 18.92x, yielding 4.67x, 4.00x, and 4.06x overall performance improvement in the above methods, respectively. Our design enables the real-time performance while consuming only 2.4W and maintaining accuracy, which is comparable to the software counterparts and even the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

To achieve such a comprehensive sensor fusion system, one has to tackle several challenges such as data synchronization, multi-threading programming, bundle adjustment (BA), and conflicting coordinate frames between UWB and the onboard sensors, so as to ensure real-time localization and smooth updates in the state estimates. To this end, we propose a two stage approach. In the first stage, lidar, camera, and IMU data on a local sliding window are processed in a core odometry thread. From this local graph, new key frames are evaluated for admission to a global map. Visual feature-based loop closure is also performed to supplement the global factor graph with loop constraints. When the global factor graph satisfies a condition on spatial diversity, the BA process will be triggered to update the coordinate transform between UWB and onboard SLAM systems. The system then seamlessly transitions to the second stage where all sensors are tightly integrated in the odometry thread. The capability of our system is demonstrated via several experiments on high-fidelity graphical-physical simulation and public datasets.</p></details> |  |

A single false-positive loop-closure can have a very negative impact on SLAM problems causing an inferior trajectory to be produced or even for the optimisation to fail entirely. To address this issue, popular existing approaches define a hard switch for each loop-closure constraint. This paper presents AEROS, a novel approach to adaptively solve a robust least-squares minimisation problem by adding just a single extra latent parameter. It can be used in the back-end component of the SLAM problem to enable generalised robust cost minimisation by simultaneously estimating the continuous latent parameter along with the set of sensor poses in a single joint optimisation. This leads to a very closely curve fitting on the distribution of the residuals, thereby reducing the effect of outliers. Additionally, we formulate the robust optimisation problem using standard Gaussian factors so that it can be solved by direct application of popular incremental estimation approaches such as iSAM. Experimental results on publicly available synthetic datasets and real LiDAR-SLAM datasets collected from the 2D and 3D LiDAR systems show the competitiveness of our approach with the state-of-the-art techniques and its superiority on real world scenarios.</p></details> | 13 |

Although some systems exist already, they are either not accurate or they struggle in real-time setting. In this paper, we propose a fast, accurate and modular LiDAR SLAM system for both batch and online estimation. We first apply downsampling and outlier removal, to filter out noise and reduce the size of the input point clouds. Filtered clouds are then used for pose tracking and floor detection, to ground-optimize the estimated trajectory. The availability of a pre-tracker, working in parallel with the filtering process, allows to obtain pre-computed odometries, to be used as aids when performing tracking. Efficient loop closure and pose optimization, achieved through a g2o pose graph, are the last steps of the proposed SLAM pipeline. We compare the performance of our system with state-of-the-art point cloud based methods, LOAM, LeGO-LOAM, A-LOAM, LeGO-LOAM-BOR and HDL, and show that the proposed system achieves equal or better accuracy and can easily handle even cases without loops.

Against the backdrop of more affordable 3D LiDAR sensors, research on 3D LiDAR SLAM is becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, the re-localization problem with a point cloud map is the foundation for other SLAM applications. In this paper, a template matching framework is proposed to re-localize a robot globally in a 3D LiDAR map. This presents two main challenges. First, most global descriptors for point cloud can only be used for place detection under a small local area. Therefore, in order to re-localize globally in the map, point clouds and descriptors(templates) are densely collected using a reconstructed mesh model at an offline stage by a physical simulation engine to expand the functional distance of point cloud descriptors. Second, the increased number of collected templates makes the matching stage too slow to meet the real-time requirement, for which a cascade matching method is presented for better efficiency. In the experiments, the proposed framework achieves 0.2-meter accuracy at about 10Hz matching speed using pure python implementation with 100k templates, which is effective and efficient for SLAM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec- tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module. Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures. DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy, especially in indoor environments such as long corridors</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS Active Perception Workshop</p></details> |

These challenges lead to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation. This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight, IENC-compatible format. Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly available</p></details> |  |

Designed specifically for fusing LiDAR odometry in multisensor systems, the proposed method ensures accurate pose estimation and consistent noise parameter inference, even in LiDAR-degraded environments. By approximating the posterior distribution using particles within the Stein Variational Inference framework, SVN-ICP eliminates the need for explicit noise modeling or manual parameter tuning. To evaluate its effectiveness, we integrate SVN-ICP into a simple error-state Kalman filter alongside an IMU and test it across multiple datasets spanning diverse environments and robot types. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms best-in-class methods on challenging scenarios while providing reliable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

While some smoothing-based LO methods have been proposed, most require matching against multiple scans, resulting in sub-real-time performance. Due to this, most prior works estimate a single state at a time and are ``submap''-based. This architecture propagates any error in pose estimation to the fixed submap and can cause jittery trajectories and degrade future registrations. We propose Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative Mapping (FORM), a LO method that performs smoothing over a densely connected factor graph while utilizing a single iterative map for matching. This allows for both real-time performance and active correction of the local map as pose estimates are further refined. We evaluate on a wide variety of datasets to show that FORM is robust, accurate, real-time, and provides smooth trajectory estimates when compared to prior state-of-the-art LO methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[An Adaptive ICP LiDAR Odometry Based on Reliable Initial Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22058v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map, achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds. Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy of LiDAR odometry.</p></details> |  |

We present Omni-LIVO, the first tightly coupled multi-camera LIVO system that bridges the FoV mismatch between wide-angle LiDAR and conventional cameras. Omni-LIVO introduces a Cross-View direct tracking strategy that maintains photometric consistency across non-overlapping views, and extends the Error-State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) with multi-view updates and adaptive covariance weighting. The system is evaluated on public benchmarks and our custom dataset, showing improved accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art LIVO, LIO, and visual-inertial baselines.

| **[Adaptive Motorized LiDAR Scanning Control for Robust Localization with OpenStreetMap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11742v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-to-OpenStreetMap (OSM) localization has gained increasing attention, as OSM provides lightweight global priors such as building footprints. These priors enhance global consistency for robot navigation, but OSM is often incomplete or outdated, limiting its reliability in real-world deployment. Meanwhile, LiDAR itself suffers from a limited field of view (FoV), where motorized rotation is commonly used to achieve panoramic coverage. Existing motorized LiDAR systems, however, typically employ constant-speed scanning that disregards both scene structure and map priors, leading to wasted effort in feature-sparse regions and degraded localization accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive LiDAR Scanning with OSM guidance, a framework that integrates global priors with local observability prediction to improve localization robustness. Specifically, we augment uncertainty-aware model predictive control with an OSM-aware term that adaptively allocates scanning effort according to both scene-dependent observability and the spatial distribution of OSM features. The method is implemented in ROS with a motorized LiDAR odometry backend and evaluated in both simulation and real-world experiments. Results on campus roads, indoor corridors, and urban environments demonstrate significant reductions in trajectory error compared to constant-speed baselines, while maintaining scan completeness. These findings highlight the potential of coupling open-source maps with adaptive LiDAR scanning to achieve robust and efficient localization in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency, with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Active Training for Deep LiDAR Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03211v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably, our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing Unsupervised Lidar Odometry Model from Normal to Snowy Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02011v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use. In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications. To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective detection of sparse and discrete noise. We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across a wider range of environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

One key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used, without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16 and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than 250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps.

Because of this, in recent years there has been significant work done to fine the most accurate method to perform state estimation using these sensors. In each of these prior works, an explosion of possible technique combinations has occurred, with each work comparing LiDAR Odometry (LO) "pipelines" to prior "pipelines". Unfortunately, little work up to this point has performed the significant amount of ablation studies comparing the various building-blocks of a LO pipeline. In this work, we summarize the various techniques that go into defining a LO pipeline and empirically evaluate these LO components on an expansive number of datasets across environments, LiDAR types, and vehicle motions. Finally, we make empirically-backed recommendations for the design of future LO pipelines to provide the most accurate and reliable performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

We propose a novel LiDAR-Visual odometry framework that integrates LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively, ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities. Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art visual and LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Doppler Correspondence: Non-Iterative Scan Matching With Doppler Velocity-Based Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11461v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving successful scan matching is essential for LiDAR odometry. However, in challenging environments with adverse weather conditions or repetitive geometric patterns, LiDAR odometry performance is degraded due to incorrect scan matching. Recently, the emergence of frequency-modulated continuous wave 4D LiDAR and 4D radar technologies has provided the potential to address these unfavorable conditions. The term 4D refers to point cloud data characterized by range, azimuth, and elevation along with Doppler velocity. Although 4D data is available, most scan matching methods for 4D LiDAR and 4D radar still establish correspondence by repeatedly identifying the closest points between consecutive scans, overlooking the Doppler information. This paper introduces, for the first time, a simple Doppler velocity-based correspondence -- Doppler Correspondence -- that is invariant to translation and small rotation of the sensor, with its geometric and kinematic foundations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enables the direct matching of consecutive point clouds without an iterative process, making it computationally efficient. Additionally, it provides a more robust correspondence estimation in environments with repetitive geometric patterns.The implementation of our proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/Tars0523/Doppler Correspondence.</p></details> |  |
| **[CURL-SLAM: Continuous and Compact LiDAR Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21077v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies 3D LiDAR mapping with a focus on developing an updatable and localizable map representation that enables continuity, compactness and consistency in 3D maps. Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require extensive storage to preserve structural details in large-scale environments. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the Continuous and Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) introduced in [1]. Our proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps capable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's spherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency after loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR odometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique optimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle Adjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction. Experimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D mapping quality and competitive LiDAR trajectory accuracy, delivering sensor-rate real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU. We will release the CURL-SLAM implementation to the community.</p></details> |  |

The proposed methods, named E-InEKF and E-IS, fuse kinematics, IMU, LiDAR, and GPS data to mitigate position drift, particularly along the z-axis, a common issue in proprioceptive-based approaches. We derived observation models that satisfy group-affine properties to integrate LiDAR odometry and GPS into InEKF and IS. LiDAR odometry is incorporated using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration on a parallel thread, preserving the computational efficiency of proprioceptive-based state estimation. We evaluate E-InEKF and E-IS with and without exteroceptive sensors, benchmarking them against LiDAR-based odometry methods in indoor and outdoor experiments using the KAIST HOUND2 robot. Our methods achieve lower Relative Position Errors (RPE) and significantly reduce Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE), with improvements of up to 28% indoors and 40% outdoors compared to LIO-SAM and FAST-LIO2.

While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, preprint, submitted to Robotics And Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel 'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a 2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps. The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field, improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, preprint conference submission</p></details> |

Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Initialization for LiDAR-inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01451v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of the initial state, including initial velocity, gravity direction, and IMU biases, is critical for the initialization of LiDAR-inertial SLAM systems. Inaccurate initial values can reduce initialization speed or lead to failure. When the system faces urgent tasks, robust and fast initialization is required while the robot is moving, such as during the swift assessment of rescue environments after natural disasters, bomb disposal, and restarting LiDAR-inertial SLAM in rescue missions. However, existing initialization methods usually require the platform to remain stationary, which is ineffective when the robot is in motion. To address this issue, this paper introduces a robust and fast dynamic initialization method for LiDAR-inertial systems (D-LI-Init). This method iteratively aligns LiDAR-based odometry with IMU measurements to achieve system initialization. To enhance the reliability of the LiDAR odometry module, the LiDAR and gyroscope are tightly integrated within the ESIKF framework. The gyroscope compensates for rotational distortion in the point cloud. Translational distortion compensation occurs during the iterative update phase, resulting in the output of LiDAR-gyroscope odometry. The proposed method can initialize the system no matter the robot is moving or stationary. Experiments on public datasets and real-world environments demonstrate that the D-LI-Init algorithm can effectively serve various platforms, including vehicles, handheld devices, and UAVs. D-LI-Init completes dynamic initialization regardless of specific motion patterns. To benefit the research community, we have open-sourced our code and test datasets on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics</p></details> |

The system integrates global information with LIDAR-based odometry to optimize the localization state. To improve robustness and enable fast resumption of localization, this paper uses offline pointcloud maps for prior knowledge and presents a novel registration method to speed up the convergence rate.

Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |

LiDAR is a widely used sensor for pose estimation, with odometry and localization being two primary tasks. LiDAR odometry estimates the relative motion between consecutive scans, while LiDAR localization aligns real-time scans with a pre-recorded map to obtain a global pose. Although they have different objectives and application scenarios, both rely on point cloud registration as the underlying technique and face shared challenges of data corruption caused by adverse conditions (e.g., rain). While state-of-the-art (SOTA) pose estimation systems achieved high accuracy on clean data, their robustness to corrupted data remains unclear. In this work, we propose a framework to systematically evaluate five SOTA LiDAR pose estimation systems across 18 synthetic real-world point cloud corruptions. Our experiments reveal that odometry systems degrade significantly under specific corruptions, with relative position errors increasing from 0.5% to more than 80%, while localization systems remain highly robust. We further demonstrate that denoising techniques can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of noise-induced corruptions, and re-training learning-based systems with corrupted data significantly enhances the robustness against various corruption types.</p></details> |  |

However, low-quality radar points hinder its application, especially the odometry task that requires a dense and accurate matching. To fully explore the potential of 4D radar, we introduce a learning-based odometry framework, enabling robust ego-motion estimation from finite and uncertain geometry information. First, for sparse radar points, we propose a local completion to supplement missing structures and provide denser guideline for aligning two frames. Then, a context-aware association with a hierarchical structure flexibly matches points of different scales aided by feature similarity, and improves local matching consistency through correlation balancing. Finally, we present a window-based optimizer that uses historical priors to establish a coupling state estimation and correct errors of inter-frame matching. The superiority of our algorithm is confirmed on View-of-Delft dataset, achieving around a 50% performance improvement over previous approaches and delivering accuracy on par with LiDAR odometry.

Simultaneously receiving data from both the LiDAR and the camera, the framework utilizes the color information from the camera images to colorize the LiDAR point clouds and then performs iterative pose optimization. For each LiDAR scan, the edge and planar features are extracted and colored using the corresponding image and then matched to a global map. Specifically, we adopt a perceptually uniform color difference weighting strategy to exclude color correspondence outliers and a robust error metric based on the Welsch's function to mitigate the impact of positional correspondence outliers during the pose optimization process. As a result, the system achieves accurate localization and reconstructs dense, accurate, colored and three-dimensional (3D) maps of the environment. Thorough experiments with challenging scenarios, including complex forests and a campus, show that our method provides higher robustness and accuracy compared with current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing radar odometry has overcome these challenges with strategies such as filtering spurious points, exploiting Doppler velocity, or integrating with inertial measurements. This paper presents two novel improvements beyond the existing radar-inertial odometry: ground-optimized noise filtering and continuous velocity preintegration. Despite the widespread use of ground planes in LiDAR odometry, imprecise ground point distributions of radar measurements cause naive plane fitting to fail. Unlike plane fitting in LiDAR, we introduce a zone-based uncertainty-aware ground modeling specifically designed for radar. Secondly, we note that radar velocity measurements can be better combined with IMU for a more accurate preintegration in radar-inertial odometry. Existing methods often ignore temporal discrepancies between radar and IMU by simplifying the complexities of asynchronous data streams with discretized propagation models. Tackling this issue, we leverage GP and formulate a continuous preintegration method for tightly integrating 3-DOF linear velocity with IMU, facilitating full 6-DOF motion directly from the raw measurements.

| **[CTE-MLO: Continuous-time and Efficient Multi-LiDAR Odometry with Localizability-aware Point Cloud Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04901v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, LiDAR-based localization and mapping methods have achieved significant progress thanks to their reliable and real-time localization capability. Considering single LiDAR odometry often faces hardware failures and degeneracy in practical scenarios, Multi-LiDAR Odometry (MLO), as an emerging technology, is studied to enhance the performance of LiDAR-based localization and mapping systems. However, MLO can suffer from high computational complexity introduced by dense point clouds that are fused from multiple LiDARs, and the continuous-time measurement characteristic is constantly neglected by existing LiDAR odometry. This motivates us to develop a Continuous-Time and Efficient MLO, namely CTE-MLO, which can achieve accurate and real-time estimation using multi-LiDAR measurements through a continuous-time perspective. In this paper, the Gaussian process estimation is naturally combined with the Kalman filter, which enables each LiDAR point in a point stream to query the corresponding continuous-time trajectory using its time instants. A decentralized multi-LiDAR synchronization scheme is also devised to combine points from separate LiDARs into a single point cloud without the primary LiDAR assignment. Moreover, with the aim of improving the real-time performance of MLO without sacrificing robustness, a point cloud sampling strategy is designed with the consideration of localizability. To this end, CTE-MLO integrates synchronization, localizability-aware sampling, continuous-time estimation, and voxel map management within a Kalman filter framework, which can achieve high accuracy and robust continuous-time estimation within only a few linear iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through various scenarios, including public datasets and real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/shenhm516/CTE-MLO to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR odometry systems are usually based on some form of point cloud registration to compute the ego-motion of a mobile robot. Yet, few of today's LiDAR odometry systems consider domain-specific knowledge or the kinematic model of the mobile platform during the point cloud alignment. In this paper, we present Kinematic-ICP, a LiDAR odometry system that focuses on wheeled mobile robots equipped with a 3D LiDAR and moving on a planar surface, which is a common assumption for warehouses, offices, hospitals, etc. Our approach introduces kinematic constraints within the optimization of a traditional point-to-point iterative closest point scheme. In this way, the resulting motion follows the kinematic constraints of the platform, effectively exploiting the robot's wheel odometry and the 3D LiDAR observations. We dynamically adjust the influence of LiDAR measurements and wheel odometry in our optimization scheme, allowing the system to handle degenerate scenarios such as feature-poor corridors. We evaluate our approach on robots operating in large-scale warehouse environments, but also outdoors. The experiments show that our approach achieves top performances and is more accurate than wheel odometry and common LiDAR odometry systems. Kinematic-ICP has been recently deployed in the Dexory fleet of robots operating in warehouses worldwide at their customers' sites, showing that our method can run in the real world alongside a complete navigation stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Yet, no available dataset recording method allows for fully dense accurate depth estimation in a large scale dynamic environment. In this paper, we introduce DOC-Depth, a novel, efficient and easy-to-deploy approach for dense depth generation from any LiDAR sensor. After reconstructing consistent dense 3D environment using LiDAR odometry, we address dynamic objects occlusions automatically thanks to DOC, our state-of-the art dynamic object classification method. Additionally, DOC-Depth is fast and scalable, allowing for the creation of unbounded datasets in terms of size and time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the KITTI dataset, improving its density from 16.1% to 71.2% and release this new fully dense depth annotation, to facilitate future research in the domain. We also showcase results using various LiDAR sensors and in multiple environments.

| **[OpenLiDARMap: Zero-Drift Point Cloud Mapping using Map Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11111v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate localization is a critical component of mobile autonomous systems, especially in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-denied environments where traditional methods fail. In such scenarios, environmental sensing is essential for reliable operation. However, approaches such as LiDAR odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) suffer from drift over long distances, especially in the absence of loop closures. Map-based localization offers a robust alternative, but the challenge lies in creating and georeferencing maps without GNSS support. To address this issue, we propose a method for creating georeferenced maps without GNSS by using publicly available data, such as building footprints and surface models derived from sparse aerial scans. Our approach integrates these data with onboard LiDAR scans to produce dense, accurate, georeferenced 3D point cloud maps. By combining an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) scan-to-scan and scan-to-map matching strategy, we achieve high local consistency without suffering from long-term drift. Thus, we eliminate the reliance on GNSS for the creation of georeferenced maps. The results demonstrate that LiDAR-only mapping can produce accurate georeferenced point cloud maps when augmented with existing map priors.</p></details> |  |

However, a notable gap exists in evaluating datasets representing natural, unstructured environments such as forests or gardens. To address this, we present a study on localisation at the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan. This area encompasses open grassy areas, paved pathways, and densely vegetated sections with trees and other objects. The dataset was recorded using a 128-beam LiDAR sensor and GPS and IMU readings to track the ego-vehicle. This paper evaluates the performance of two state-of-the-art LiDARinertial odometry frameworks, COIN-LIO and LIO-SAM, on this dataset. We analyse trajectory estimates in both horizontal and vertical dimensions and assess relative translation and yaw errors over varying distances. Our findings reveal that while both frameworks perform adequately in the vertical plane, COINLIO demonstrates superior accuracy in the horizontal plane, particularly over extended trajectories. In contrast, LIO-SAM shows increased drift and yaw errors over longer distances.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2024 Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA 2024)</p></details> |

Motorized LiDAR systems can expand the Field of View (FoV) without adding multiple scanners, but existing motorized LiDAR systems often rely on constant-speed motor control, leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments. To address this, we propose UA-MPC, an uncertainty-aware motor control strategy that balances scanning accuracy and efficiency. By predicting discrete observabilities of LiDAR Odometry (LO) through ray tracing and modeling their distribution with a surrogate function, UA-MPC efficiently optimizes motor speed control according to different scenes. Additionally, we develop a ROS-based realistic simulation environment for motorized LiDAR systems, enabling the evaluation of control strategies across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments, conducted on both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our method significantly improves odometry accuracy while preserving the scanning efficiency of motorized LiDAR systems. Specifically, it achieves over a 60\% reduction in positioning error with less than a 2\% decrease in efficiency compared to constant-speed control, offering a smarter and more effective solution for active 3D sensing tasks.

| **[A Real-time Degeneracy Sensing and Compensation Method for Enhanced LiDAR SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07513v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Adaptive LiDAR Odometry and Mapping for Autonomous Agricultural Mobile Robots in Unmanned Farms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02899v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned and intelligent agricultural systems are crucial for enhancing agricultural efficiency and for helping mitigate the effect of labor shortage. However, unlike urban environments, agricultural fields impose distinct and unique challenges on autonomous robotic systems, such as the unstructured and dynamic nature of the environment, the rough and uneven terrain, and the resulting non-smooth robot motion. To address these challenges, this work introduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for autonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural environments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry algorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping module that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for selective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to prioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted points and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in odometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art methods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments featuring various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles. Results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation and mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural settings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and accumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational efficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods. The source code of the developed method and the associated field dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/AG-LOAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiDAR-based Registration against Georeferenced Models for Globally Consistent Allocentric Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02533v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are irreplaceable in search and rescue (SAR) missions to obtain a situational overview or provide closeups without endangering personnel. However, UAVs heavily rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for localization which works well in open spaces, but the precision drastically degrades in the vicinity of buildings. These inaccuracies hinder aggregation of diverse data from multiple sources in a unified georeferenced frame for SAR operators. In contrast, CityGML models provide approximate building shapes with accurate georeferenced poses. Besides, LiDAR works best in the vicinity of 3D structures. Hence, we refine coarse GNSS measurements by registering LiDAR maps against CityGML and digital elevation map (DEM) models as a prior for allocentric mapping. An intuitive plausibility score selects the best hypothesis based on occupancy using a 2D height map. Afterwards, we integrate the registration results in a continuous-time spline-based pose graph optimizer with LiDAR odometry and further sensing modalities to obtain globally consistent, georeferenced trajectories and maps. We evaluate the viability of our approach on multiple flights captured at two distinct testing sites. Our method successfully reduced GNSS offset errors from up-to 16 m to below 0.5 m on multiple flights. Furthermore, we obtain globally consistent maps w.r.t. prior 3D geospatial models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR), New York City, USA, November 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches to dynamic object detection often rely on pretrained learned networks or computationally expensive volumetric maps. To enhance efficiency on computationally limited robots, we reuse data between the odometry and detection module. Utilizing a range image segmentation technique and a novel residual-based heuristic, our method distinguishes dynamic from static objects before integrating them into the point cloud map. The approach demonstrates robust object tracking and improved map accuracy in environments with numerous dynamic objects. Even highly non-rigid objects, such as running humans, are accurately detected at point level without prior downsampling of the point cloud and hence, without loss of information. Evaluation on simulated and real-world data validates its computational efficiency. Compared to a state-of-the-art volumetric method, our approach shows comparable detection performance at a fraction of the processing time, adding only 14 ms to the odometry module for dynamic object detection and tracking. The implementation and a new real-world dataset are available as open-source for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

However, the performance of LiDAR odometry varies depending on the environment and deteriorates in degenerative environments such as long corridors. This issue stems from the dependence on a single error metric, which has different strengths and weaknesses depending on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel iterative closest point (ICP) method called GenZ-ICP. We revisited both point-to-plane and point-to-point error metrics and propose a method that leverages their strengths in a complementary manner. Moreover, adaptability to diverse environments was enhanced by utilizing an adaptive weight that is adjusted based on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. As demonstrated in our experimental evaluation, the proposed GenZ-ICP exhibits high adaptability to various environments and resilience to optimization degradation in corridor-like degenerative scenarios by preventing ill-posed problems during the optimization process.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

However, fusing these two modalities typically requires a highly accurate calibration between them. In this paper, we propose MDPCalib which is a novel method for camera-LiDAR calibration that requires neither human supervision nor any specific target objects. Instead, we utilize sensor motion estimates from visual and LiDAR odometry as well as deep learning-based 2D-pixel-to-3D-point correspondences that are obtained without in-domain retraining. We represent camera-LiDAR calibration as an optimization problem and minimize the costs induced by constraints from sensor motion and point correspondences. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields highly accurate extrinsic calibration parameters and is robust to random initialization. Additionally, our approach generalizes to a wide range of sensor setups, which we demonstrate by employing it on various robotic platforms including a self-driving perception car, a quadruped robot, and a UAV. To make our calibration method publicly accessible, we release the code on our project website at http://calibration.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Particularly under conditions where the exteroceptive sensors, which the navigation depends on, can be degraded by environmental challenges thus, leading to mission failure. It is precisely in such challenges where the potential for FMCW radar sensors is highlighted: as a complementary exteroceptive sensing modality with direct velocity measuring capabilities. In this work we integrate radial speed measurements from a FMCW radar sensor, using a radial speed factor, to provide linear velocity updates into a sliding-window state estimator for fusion with LiDAR pose and IMU measurements. We demonstrate that this augmentation increases the robustness of the state estimator to challenging conditions present in the environment and the negative effects they can pose to vulnerable exteroceptive modalities. The proposed method is extensively evaluated using robotic field experiments conducted using an autonomous, full-scale, off-road vehicle operating at high-speeds (~12 m/s) in complex desert environments. Furthermore, the robustness of the approach is demonstrated for cases of both simulated and real-world degradation of the LiDAR odometry performance along with comparison against state-of-the-art methods for radar-inertial odometry on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Robust Loop Closure by Textual Cues in Challenging Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15869v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure is an important task in robot navigation. However, existing methods mostly rely on some implicit or heuristic features of the environment, which can still fail to work in common environments such as corridors, tunnels, and warehouses. Indeed, navigating in such featureless, degenerative, and repetitive (FDR) environments would also pose a significant challenge even for humans, but explicit text cues in the surroundings often provide the best assistance. This inspires us to propose a multi-modal loop closure method based on explicit human-readable textual cues in FDR environments. Specifically, our approach first extracts scene text entities based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), then creates a local map of text cues based on accurate LiDAR odometry and finally identifies loop closure events by a graph-theoretic scheme. Experiment results demonstrate that this approach has superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on visual and LiDAR sensors.

In this work, we propose an Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-only Odometry, utilizing straightforward and efficient linear interpolation. Our method flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according to the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability enhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in challenging, feature-sparse environments. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets across different platforms, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LiDAR-only odometry methods. Notably, in scenarios involving aggressive motion and sparse features, our method outperforms existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

This approach enables the direct combination of translation and orientation errors via dual quaternion operations, greatly enhancing pose estimation, as demonstrated in comparative experiments against other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach reduced drift error compared to other LiDAR-only-odometry methods, especially in scenarios with sharp curves and aggressive movements with large angular displacement. DualQuat-LOAM is benchmarked against several public datasets. In the KITTI dataset it has a translation and rotation error of 0.79% and 0.0039{\deg}/m, with an average run time of 53 ms.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRLO: An Efficient LiDAR Odometry with 3D Dynamic Object Tracking and Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13240v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous state estimation and mapping is an essential capability for mobile robots working in dynamic urban environment. The majority of existing SLAM solutions heavily rely on a primarily static assumption. However, due to the presence of moving vehicles and pedestrians, this assumption does not always hold, leading to localization accuracy decreased and maps distorted. To address this challenge, we propose TRLO, a dynamic LiDAR odometry that efficiently improves the accuracy of state estimation and generates a cleaner point cloud map. To efficiently detect dynamic objects in the surrounding environment, a deep learning-based method is applied, generating detection bounding boxes. We then design a 3D multi-object tracker based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and nearest neighbor (NN) strategy to reliably identify and remove dynamic objects. Subsequently, a fast two-stage iterative nearest point solver is employed to solve the state estimation using cleaned static point cloud. Note that a novel hash-based keyframe database management is proposed for fast access to search keyframes. Furthermore, all the detected object bounding boxes are leveraged to impose posture consistency constraint to further refine the final state estimation. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies conducted on the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves more accurate state estimation but also generates cleaner maps, compared with baselines.</p></details> | 8pages, 5figures |
| **[C$^3$P-VoxelMap: Compact, Cumulative and Coalescible Probabilistic Voxel Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01195v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

First, an adaptive submap joining strategy is employed to generate prior submaps (keyframes and poses) for the central session, and to provide priors for subsidiaries when constraints are needed for robust localization. Next, a coarse-to-fine pose initialization for subsidiary sessions is performed using vertical recognition and ICP refinement in the global coordinate frame. To elevate the accuracy of subsequent localization, we propose an egocentric factor graph (EFG) module that integrates the IMU preintegration, LiDAR odometry and scan match factors in a joint optimization manner. Specifically, the scan match factors are constructed by a novel propagation model that efficiently distributes the prior constrains as edges to the relevant prior pose nodes, weighted by noises based on keyframe registration errors. Additionally, the framework supports flexible switching between two modes: relocalization (RLM) and incremental localization (ILM) based on the proposed overlap-based mechanism to select or update the prior submaps from central session. The proposed LiLoc is tested on public and custom datasets, demonstrating accurate localization performance against state-of-the-art methods.

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

Mesh maps represent a dense and continuous map format with low memory consumption, which can approximate complex structures with simple elements, attracting significant attention of researchers in recent years. However, most implementations operate under a static environment assumption. In effect, moving objects cause ghosting, potentially degrading the quality of meshing. To address these issues, we propose a plug-and-play meshing module adapting to dynamic environments, which can easily integrate with various LiDAR odometry to generally improve the pose estimation accuracy of odometry. In our meshing module, a novel two-stage coarse-to-fine dynamic removal method is designed to effectively filter dynamic objects, generating consistent, accurate, and dense mesh maps. To our best know, this is the first mesh construction method with explicit dynamic removal. Additionally, conducive to Gaussian process in mesh construction, sliding window-based keyframe aggregation and adaptive downsampling strategies are used to ensure the uniformity of point cloud. We evaluate the localization and mapping accuracy on five publicly available datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning.

However, it remains challenging to explore effective visual-LiDAR fusion, mainly due to the intrinsic data structure inconsistency between two modalities: Image pixels are regular and dense, but LiDAR points are unordered and sparse. To address the problem, we propose a local-to-global fusion network (DVLO) with bi-directional structure alignment. To obtain locally fused features, we project points onto the image plane as cluster centers and cluster image pixels around each center. Image pixels are pre-organized as pseudo points for image-to-point structure alignment. Then, we convert points to pseudo images by cylindrical projection (point-to-image structure alignment) and perform adaptive global feature fusion between point features and local fused features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI odometry and FlyingThings3D scene flow datasets compared to both single-modal and multi-modal methods.

Traditional methods for dynamic object detection rely on high accuracy odometry and maps to detect and track moving objects. However, these methods are not suitable for long-term operation in dynamic environments where the surrounding environment is constantly changing. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel system for detecting and tracking dynamic objects in real-time using only LiDAR data. By emphasizing the extraction of low-frequency components from LiDAR data as feature points for foreground objects, our method significantly reduces the time required for object clustering and movement analysis. Additionally, we have developed a tracking approach that employs intensity-based ego-motion estimation along with a sliding window technique to assess object movements. This enables the precise identification of moving objects and enhances the system's resilience to odometry drift. Our experiments show that this system can detect and track dynamic objects in real-time with an average detection accuracy of 88.7\% and a recall rate of 89.1\%. Furthermore, our system demonstrates resilience against the prolonged drift typically associated with front-end only LiDAR odometry.

However, most of the current works focus on nonlinear optimization methods, and still existing many challenges in using the traditional Iterative Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) framework to tackle the problem: IEKF only iterates over the observation equation, relying on a rough estimate of the initial state, which is insufficient to fully eliminate motion distortion in the input point cloud; the system process noise is difficult to be determined during state estimation of the complex motions; and the varying motion models across different sensor carriers. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Iteration Extended Kalman Filter (I2EKF) and the LiDAR odometry based on I2EKF (I2EKF-LO). This approach not only iterates over the observation equation but also leverages state updates to iteratively mitigate motion distortion in LiDAR point clouds. Moreover, it dynamically adjusts process noise based on the confidence level of prior predictions during state estimation and establishes motion models for different sensor carriers to achieve accurate and efficient state estimation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that I2EKF-LO achieves outstanding levels of accuracy and computational efficiency in the realm of LiDAR odometry. Additionally, to foster community development, our code is open-sourced.https://github.com/YWL0720/I2EKF-LO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU. Codes will be available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PIN_SLAM.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Attention-Guided Lidar Segmentation and Odometry Using Image-to-Point Cloud Saliency Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14332v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry estimation and 3D semantic segmentation are crucial for autonomous driving, which has achieved remarkable advances recently. However, these tasks are challenging due to the imbalance of points in different semantic categories for 3D semantic segmentation and the influence of dynamic objects for LiDAR odometry estimation, which increases the importance of using representative/salient landmarks as reference points for robust feature learning. To address these challenges, we propose a saliency-guided approach that leverages attention information to improve the performance of LiDAR odometry estimation and semantic segmentation models. Unlike in the image domain, only a few studies have addressed point cloud saliency information due to the lack of annotated training data. To alleviate this, we first present a universal framework to transfer saliency distribution knowledge from color images to point clouds, and use this to construct a pseudo-saliency dataset (i.e. FordSaliency) for point clouds. Then, we adopt point cloud-based backbones to learn saliency distribution from pseudo-saliency labels, which is followed by our proposed SalLiDAR module. SalLiDAR is a saliency-guided 3D semantic segmentation model that integrates saliency information to improve segmentation performance. Finally, we introduce SalLONet, a self-supervised saliency-guided LiDAR odometry network that uses the semantic and saliency predictions of SalLiDAR to achieve better odometry estimation. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SalLiDAR and SalLONet models achieve state-of-the-art performance against existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of image-to-LiDAR saliency knowledge transfer.

Notably, existing calibration methods derive calibration parameters under the assumption that the methods require full motion in all axes. When IMU and LiDAR are mounted on a ground robot the motion of which is restricted to planar motion, existing calibration methods are likely to exhibit degraded performance. To address this issue, we present GRIL-Calib: a novel targetless Ground Robot IMU-LiDAR Calibration method. Our proposed method leverages ground information to compensate for the lack of unrestricted full motion. First, we propose LiDAR Odometry (LO) using ground plane residuals to enhance calibration accuracy. Second, we propose the Ground Plane Motion (GPM) constraint and incorporate it into the optimization for calibration, enabling the determination of full 6-DoF extrinsic parameters, including theoretically unobservable direction. Finally, unlike baseline methods, we formulate the calibration not as sequential two optimizations but as a single optimization (SO) problem, solving all calibration parameters simultaneously and improving accuracy. We validate our GRIL-Calib by applying it to various real-world datasets and comparing its performance with that of existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

This problem has been addressed by the community for more than two decades, and many effective solutions are available nowadays. Most of these systems implicitly rely on assumptions about the operating environment, the sensor used, and motion pattern. When these assumptions are violated, several well-known systems tend to perform poorly. This paper presents a LiDAR odometry system that can overcome these limitations and operate well under different operating conditions while achieving performance comparable with domain-specific methods. Our algorithm follows the well-known ICP paradigm that leverages a PCA-based kd-tree implementation that is used to extract structural information about the clouds being registered and to compute the minimization metric for the alignment. The drift is bound by managing the local map based on the estimated uncertainty of the tracked pose. To benefit the community, we release an open-source C++ anytime real-time implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rvp-group/mad-icp</p></details> |

Understanding the semantics of the surrounding environment and accurate vehicle pose estimation are essential capabilities for autonomous vehicles, including self-driving cars and mobile robots that perform complex tasks. Fast moving platforms like self-driving cars impose a hard challenge for localization and mapping algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel framework for real-time LiDAR odometry and mapping based on LOAM architecture for fast moving platforms. Our framework utilizes semantic information produced by a deep learning model to improve point-to-line and point-to-plane matching between LiDAR scans and build a semantic map of the environment, leading to more accurate motion estimation using LiDAR data. We observe that including semantic information in the matching process introduces a new type of outlier matches to the process, where matching occur between different objects of the same semantic class. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm that explicitly identifies and discards potential outliers in the matching process. In our experiments, we study the effect of improving the matching process on the robustness of LiDAR odometry against high speed motion. Our experimental evaluations on KITTI dataset demonstrate that utilizing semantic information and rejecting outliers significantly enhance the robustness of LiDAR odometry and mapping when there are large gaps between scan acquisition poses, which is typical for fast moving platforms.</p></details> |  |

In the existing works, iterative closest point (ICP) is widely used since it is precise and efficient. Due to its non-convexity and its local iterative strategy, however, ICP-based method easily falls into local optima, which in turn calls for a precise initialization. In this paper, we propose CoFi, a Coarse-to-Fine ICP algorithm for LiDAR localization. Specifically, the proposed algorithm down-samples the input point sets under multiple voxel resolution, and gradually refines the transformation from the coarse point sets to the fine-grained point sets. In addition, we propose a map based LiDAR localization algorithm that extracts semantic feature points from the LiDAR frames and apply CoFi to estimate the pose on an efficient point cloud map. With the help of the Cylinder3D algorithm for LiDAR scan semantic segmentation, the proposed CoFi localization algorithm demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI odometry benchmark, with significant improvement over the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revise to new article</p></details> |

To address the issue of LiDAR odometry drift in high-noise settings, integrating clustering methods to filter out unstable features has become an effective module of SLAM frameworks. However, reducing the amount of point cloud data can lead to potential loss of information and possible degeneration. As a result, this research proposes a LiDAR odometry that can dynamically assess the point cloud's reliability. The algorithm aims to improve adaptability in diverse settings by selecting important feature points with sensitivity to the level of environmental degeneration. Firstly, a fast adaptive Euclidean clustering algorithm based on range image is proposed, which, combined with depth clustering, extracts the primary structural points of the environment defined as ambient skeleton points. Then, the environmental degeneration level is computed through the dense normal features of the skeleton points, and the point cloud cleaning is dynamically adjusted accordingly. The algorithm is validated on the KITTI benchmark and real environments, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness in different environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Perspective Error in Voxel-Based Lidar Scan Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13416v1)** | 2024-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper quantifies an error source that limits the accuracy of lidar scan matching, particularly for voxel-based methods. Lidar scan matching, which is used in dead reckoning (also known as lidar odometry) and mapping, computes the rotation and translation that best align a pair of point clouds. Perspective errors occur when a scene is viewed from different angles, with different surfaces becoming visible or occluded from each viewpoint. To explain perspective anomalies observed in data, this paper models perspective errors for two objects representative of urban landscapes: a cylindrical column and a dual-wall corner. For each object, we provide an analytical model of the perspective error for voxel-based lidar scan matching. We then analyze how perspective errors accumulate as a lidar-equipped vehicle moves past these objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[LinK3D: Linear Keypoints Representation for 3D LiDAR Point Cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05927v3)** | 2024-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature extraction and matching are the basic parts of many robotic vision tasks, such as 2D or 3D object detection, recognition, and registration. As is known, 2D feature extraction and matching have already achieved great success. Unfortunately, in the field of 3D, the current methods may fail to support the extensive application of 3D LiDAR sensors in robotic vision tasks due to their poor descriptiveness and inefficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a novel 3D feature representation method: Linear Keypoints representation for 3D LiDAR point cloud, called LinK3D. The novelty of LinK3D lies in that it fully considers the characteristics (such as the sparsity and complexity) of LiDAR point clouds and represents the keypoint with its robust neighbor keypoints, which provide strong constraints in the description of the keypoint. The proposed LinK3D has been evaluated on three public datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves great matching performance. More importantly, LinK3D also shows excellent real-time performance, faster than the sensor frame rate at 10 Hz of a typical rotating LiDAR sensor. LinK3D only takes an average of 30 milliseconds to extract features from the point cloud collected by a 64-beam LiDAR and takes merely about 20 milliseconds to match two LiDAR scans when executed on a computer with an Intel Core i7 processor. Moreover, our method can be extended to LiDAR odometry task, and shows good scalability. We release the implementation of our method at https://github.com/YungeCui/LinK3D.</p></details> |  |

The main goal of odometry is to predict the robot's motion and accurately determine its current location. Various sensors, such as wheel encoder, inertial measurement unit (IMU), camera, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), are used for odometry in robotics. LiDAR, in particular, has gained attention for its ability to provide rich three-dimensional (3D) data and immunity to light variations. This survey aims to examine advancements in LiDAR odometry thoroughly. We start by exploring LiDAR technology and then scrutinize LiDAR odometry works, categorizing them based on their sensor integration approaches. These approaches include methods relying solely on LiDAR, those combining LiDAR with IMU, strategies involving multiple LiDARs, and methods fusing LiDAR with other sensor modalities. In conclusion, we address existing challenges and outline potential future directions in LiDAR odometry. Additionally, we analyze public datasets and evaluation methods for LiDAR odometry.

In this study, we propose a novel LiDAR odometry which effectively utilizes the overall exterior characteristics of environmental landmarks. The vehicle pose estimation is accomplished by means of two sequential pose estimation stages, namely, horizontal pose estimation and vertical pose estimation. To achieve effective landmark registration, a comprehensive index is proposed to evaluate the level of similarity between landmarks. This index takes into account two crucial aspects of landmarks, namely, dimension and shape in evaluating their similarity. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, we utilize the widely recognized KITTI dataset as well as experimental data collected by an unmanned ground vehicle platform. Both graphical and numerical results indicate that our algorithm outperforms leading LiDAR odometry solutions in terms of positioning accuracy.</p></details> |  |

They are usually sensitive to noise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a real-time mesh-based LiDAR odometry and mapping approach for large-scale scenes via implicit reconstruction and a parallel spatial-hashing scheme. To efficiently reconstruct triangular meshes, we suggest an incremental voxel meshing method that updates every scan by traversing each point once and compresses space via a scalable partition module. By taking advantage of rapid accessing triangular meshes at any time, we design point-to-mesh odometry with location and feature-based data association to estimate the poses between the incoming point clouds and the recovered triangular meshes. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in generating accurate motion trajectories and environmental mesh maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile LiDAR-Inertial Odometry With SE (2) Constraints for Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01584v1)** | 2023-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR SLAM has become one of the major localization systems for ground vehicles since LiDAR Odometry And Mapping (LOAM). Many extension works on LOAM mainly leverage one specific constraint to improve the performance, e.g., information from on-board sensors such as loop closure and inertial state; prior conditions such as ground level and motion dynamics. In many robotic applications, these conditions are often known partially, hence a SLAM system can be a comprehensive problem due to the existence of numerous constraints. Therefore, we can achieve a better SLAM result by fusing them properly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages both the on-board perception system and prior information such as motion dynamics to improve localization performance. In particular, we consider the case for ground vehicles, which are commonly used for autonomous driving and warehouse logistics. We present a computationally efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry method that directly parameterizes ground vehicle poses on SE(2). The out-of-SE(2) motion perturbations are not neglected but incorporated into an integrated noise term of a novel SE(2)-constraints model. For odometric measurement processing, we propose a versatile, tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve better pose estimation than traditional LiDAR odometry. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate our proposed method's performance in different scenarios, including localization for both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

This substantially reduces computation time and the required features for odometry estimation in LOAM-based algorithms. Our odometry estimation method does not rely on global maps or loop closure algorithms, which further reduces computational costs. Experimental results generate a translation and rotation error of 0.86\% and 0.0036{\deg}/m on the KITTI dataset with an average runtime of 78ms.

However, there are several challenges for these new LiDAR sensors, including small field of view, severe motion distortions, and irregular patterns, which hinder them from being widely used in LiDAR odometry, practically. To tackle these problems, we present an effective continuous-time LiDAR odometry (ECTLO) method for the Risley-prism-based LiDARs with non-repetitive scanning patterns. A single range image covering historical points in LiDAR's small FoV is adopted for efficient map representation. To account for the noisy data from occlusions after map updating, a filter-based point-to-plane Gaussian Mixture Model is used for robust registration. Moreover, a LiDAR-only continuous-time motion model is employed to relieve the inevitable distortions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various testbeds using the prism-based LiDARs with different scanning patterns, whose promising results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

In this article, we propose a novel approach to improve the accuracy of visual localization using Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques. We highlight the limitations of global SfM, which suffers from high latency, and the challenges of local SfM, which requires large image databases for accurate reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose utilizing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), as opposed to image databases, to cut down on the space required for storage. We suggest that sampling reference images around the prior query position can lead to further improvements. We evaluate the accuracy of our proposed method against ground truth obtained using LIDAR and Advanced Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time (A-LOAM), and compare its storage usage against local SfM with COLMAP in the conducted experiments. Our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 0.068 meters compared to the ground truth, which is slightly lower than the most advanced method COLMAP, which has an accuracy of 0.022 meters. However, the size of the database required for COLMAP is 400 megabytes, whereas the size of our NeRF model is only 160 megabytes. Finally, we perform an ablation study to assess the impact of using reference images from the NeRF reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Reliability and efficiency are the two most valued features for applying SLAM in robot applications. In this paper, we consider achieving a reliable LiDAR-based SLAM function in computation-limited platforms, such as quadrotor UAVs based on graph-based point cloud association. First, contrary to most works selecting salient features for point cloud registration, we propose a non-conspicuous feature selection strategy for reliability and robustness purposes. Then a two-stage correspondence selection method is used to register the point cloud, which includes a KD-tree-based coarse matching followed by a graph-based matching method that uses geometric consistency to vote out incorrect correspondences. Additionally, we propose an odometry approach where the weight optimizations are guided by vote results from the aforementioned geometric consistency graph. In this way, the optimization of LiDAR odometry rapidly converges and evaluates a fairly accurate transformation resulting in the back-end module efficiently finishing the mapping task. Finally, we evaluate our proposed framework on the KITTI odometry dataset and real-world environments. Experiments show that our SLAM system achieves a comparative level or higher level of accuracy with more balanced computation efficiency compared with the mainstream LiDAR-based SLAM solutions.</p></details> |  |

Existing learning-based 3D descriptors and keypoint detectors are either independent or loosely coupled, so they cannot fully adapt to each other. In this work, we propose a tightly coupled keypoint detector and descriptor (TCKDD) based on a multi-task fully convolutional network with a probabilistic detection loss. In particular, this self-supervised detection loss fully adapts the keypoint detector to any jointly learned descriptors and benefits the self-supervised learning of descriptors. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that our TCKDD achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud registration. Furthermore, we design a keypoint detector and descriptors-assisted LiDAR odometry and mapping framework (KDD-LOAM), whose real-time odometry relies on keypoint descriptor matching-based RANSAC. The sparse keypoints are further used for efficient scan-to-map registration and mapping. Experiments on KITTI dataset demonstrate that KDD-LOAM significantly surpasses LOAM and shows competitive performance in odometry.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the mainstreamed approaches that focus on improving the accuracy by the additional inertial sensors, this letter explores the capability of LiDAR-only odometry through a continuous-time perspective. Firstly, the measurements of LiDAR are regarded as streaming points continuously captured at high frequency. Secondly, the LiDAR movement is parameterized by a simple yet effective continuous-time trajectory. Therefore, our proposed Traj-LO approach tries to recover the spatial-temporal consistent movement of LiDAR by tightly coupling the geometric information from LiDAR points and kinematic constraints from trajectory smoothness. This framework is generalized for different kinds of LiDAR as well as multi-LiDAR systems. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed LiDAR-only approach, even in scenarios where the kinematic state exceeds the IMU's measuring range. Our implementation is open-sourced on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video https://youtu.be/hbtKzElYKkQ?si=3KEVy0hlHBsKV8j0 and Project site https://github.com/kevin2431/Traj-LO</p></details> |
| **[LiDAR-Generated Images Derived Keypoints Assisted Point Cloud Registration Scheme in Odometry Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10436v1)** | 2023-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keypoint detection and description play a pivotal role in various robotics and autonomous applications including visual odometry (VO), visual navigation, and Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While a myriad of keypoint detectors and descriptors have been extensively studied in conventional camera images, the effectiveness of these techniques in the context of LiDAR-generated images, i.e. reflectivity and ranges images, has not been assessed. These images have gained attention due to their resilience in adverse conditions such as rain or fog. Additionally, they contain significant textural information that supplements the geometric information provided by LiDAR point clouds in the point cloud registration phase, especially when reliant solely on LiDAR sensors. This addresses the challenge of drift encountered in LiDAR Odometry (LO) within geometrically identical scenarios or where not all the raw point cloud is informative and may even be misleading. This paper aims to analyze the applicability of conventional image key point extractors and descriptors on LiDAR-generated images via a comprehensive quantitative investigation. Moreover, we propose a novel approach to enhance the robustness and reliability of LO. After extracting key points, we proceed to downsample the point cloud, subsequently integrating it into the point cloud registration phase for the purpose of odometry estimation. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed approach has comparable accuracy but reduced computational overhead, higher odometry publishing rate, and even superior performance in scenarios prone to drift by using the raw point cloud. This, in turn, lays a foundation for subsequent investigations into the integration of LiDAR-generated images with LO. Our code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/TIERS/ws-lidar-as-camera-odom.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose onlineFGO, a novel time-centric graph-optimization-based localization method that fuses multiple sensor measurements with the continuous-time trajectory representation for vehicle localization tasks. We generalize the graph construction independent of any spatial sensor measurements by creating the states deterministically on time. As the trajectory representation in continuous-time enables querying states at arbitrary times, incoming sensor measurements can be factorized on the graph without requiring state alignment. We integrate different GNSS observations: pseudorange, deltarange, and time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) to ensure global reference and fuse the relative motion from a LiDAR-odometry to improve the localization consistency while GNSS observations are not available. Experiments on general performance, effects of different factors, and hyper-parameter settings are conducted in a real-world measurement campaign in Aachen city that contains different urban scenarios. Our results show an average 2D error of 0.99m and consistent state estimation in urban scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A maj...</summary><p>A major revision of this paper is available, which will be submitted to arXiv later</p></details> |
| **[A LiDAR-Inertial SLAM Tightly-Coupled with Dropout-Tolerant GNSS Fusion for Autonomous Mine Service Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11492v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal sensor integration has become a crucial prerequisite for the real-world navigation systems. Recent studies have reported successful deployment of such system in many fields. However, it is still challenging for navigation tasks in mine scenes due to satellite signal dropouts, degraded perception, and observation degeneracy. To solve this problem, we propose a LiDAR-inertial odometry method in this paper, utilizing both Kalman filter and graph optimization. The front-end consists of multiple parallel running LiDAR-inertial odometries, where the laser points, IMU, and wheel odometer information are tightly fused in an error-state Kalman filter. Instead of the commonly used feature points, we employ surface elements for registration. The back-end construct a pose graph and jointly optimize the pose estimation results from inertial, LiDAR odometry, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Since the vehicle has a long operation time inside the tunnel, the largely accumulated drift may be not fully by the GNSS measurements. We hereby leverage a loop closure based re-initialization process to achieve full alignment. In addition, the system robustness is improved through handling data loss, stream consistency, and estimation error. The experimental results show that our system has a good tolerance to the long-period degeneracy with the cooperation different LiDARs and surfel registration, achieving meter-level accuracy even for tens of minutes running during GNSS dropouts.</p></details> |  |
| **[DELO: Deep Evidential LiDAR Odometry using Partial Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07153v1)** | 2023-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, robust, and real-time LiDAR-based odometry (LO) is imperative for many applications like robot navigation, globally consistent 3D scene map reconstruction, or safe motion-planning. Though LiDAR sensor is known for its precise range measurement, the non-uniform and uncertain point sampling density induce structural inconsistencies. Hence, existing supervised and unsupervised point set registration methods fail to establish one-to-one matching correspondences between LiDAR frames. We introduce a novel deep learning-based real-time (approx. 35-40ms per frame) LO method that jointly learns accurate frame-to-frame correspondences and model's predictive uncertainty (PU) as evidence to safe-guard LO predictions. In this work, we propose (i) partial optimal transportation of LiDAR feature descriptor for robust LO estimation, (ii) joint learning of predictive uncertainty while learning odometry over driving sequences, and (iii) demonstrate how PU can serve as evidence for necessary pose-graph optimization when LO network is either under or over confident. We evaluate our method on KITTI dataset and show competitive performance, even superior generalization ability over recent state-of-the-art approaches.

However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in real-time wind forecasts (up to 30 minutes lead time). The model exhibits robustness across forecast horizons and different pressure levels, and its predictions for wind fields show superior agreement with ground-based radar wind profiler compared to concurrent European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures; Minor text revisions; Updated the questions, some images in the article, the abstract, and the main text content</p></details> |

In this context, we investigate three strategies applied specifically to GNSS pseudorange observations: robust statistics for error mitigation, machine learning for faulty measurement prediction, and Bayesian inference for noise distribution approximation. Since previous studies have provided limited insight into the theoretical foundations and practical evaluations of these three methodologies within a unified problem statement (i.e., state estimation using ranging sensors), we conduct extensive experiments using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Our goal is to examine both established techniques and newly proposed methods, thereby advancing the understanding of how to handle faulty range measurements, such as GNSS, for robust, long-term vehicle localization. In addition to presenting successful results, this work highlights critical observations and open questions to motivate future research in robust state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2nd Workshop on Safety of Intelligent and Autonomous Vehicles: Formal Methods vs. Machine Learning approaches for reliable navigation (SIAV-FM2L) at IEEE IROS2025</p></details> |

While GNSS-based navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source, particularly given the unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths. This paper characterizes these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) and a custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm that iteratively solves for bent signal paths. We simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays, as well as excess path length from ray bending, for GNSS signals received at both lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying solar and geomagnetic conditions. Results show that mean group delays are typically on the order of 1 m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high solar activity, while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude ray paths. We also quantify the influence of signal frequency, geomagnetic $K_p$ index, and solar R12 index. These findings inform the design of robust positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted NAVIGATION: Journal of the Institute of Navigation</p></details> |

Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on positioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their observability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly coupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable factor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and ambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion, while vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over state-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer positioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error of 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent improvement. To foster further research, we also release the first open-source dataset that combines IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from both rover and base stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

When GNSS ranging codes derive from a PRF utilizing a secret known only to the broadcaster, the spoofer cannot predict the ranging code before broadcast. Therefore, PRF ranging can be used to establish trust in the GNSS pseudoranges and the resulting receiver position, navigation, and timing (PNT) solution. I apply the methods herein to Galileo's Signal Authentication Service (SAS) utilizing the encrypted Galileo E6-C signal to compute that, at most, 400 ms of Galileo E6-C data to assert 128-bit authentication security under non-SCER models. For the SCER adversary, I predict the adversary's needed receiving radio equipment to break authentication security. One can use this work to design a PRF GNSS ranging protocol to meet useful authentication security requirements by computing the probability of missed detection.</p></details> |  |

Our unified SLAM framework seamlessly integrates different sensor modalities: visual, inertial, measured or learned depth, LiDAR and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. Unlike most state-of-the-art SLAM systems, we advocate using dense volumetric map representations when leveraging depth or range-sensing capabilities. We employ an efficient submapping strategy that allows our system to scale to large environments, showcased in sequences of up to 9 kilometers. OKVIS2-X enhances its accuracy and robustness by tightly-coupling the estimator and submaps through map alignment factors. Our system provides globally consistent maps, directly usable for autonomous navigation. To further improve the accuracy of OKVIS2-X, we also incorporate the option of performing online calibration of camera extrinsics. Our system achieves the highest trajectory accuracy in EuRoC against state-of-the-art alternatives, outperforms all competitors in the Hilti22 VI-only benchmark, while also proving competitive in the LiDAR version, and showcases state of the art accuracy in the diverse and large-scale sequences from the VBR dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) - Special Issue: Visual SLAM</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting the Ionosphere from Sparse GNSS Data with Temporal-Fusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00631v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations, but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.</p></details> |  |

We present a fully onboard UAV system developed for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS or prior dense mapping. The system integrates perception, mapping, planning, and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and reduced drift substantially relative to raw odometry, while running in real time on CPU-only hardware. We describe the system architecture, the localization pipeline, and the competition evaluation, and we report practical insights from field deployment that inform the design of GNSS-denied UAV autonomy.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Two stage GNSS outlier detection for factor graph optimization based GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00524v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable GNSS positioning in complex environments remains a critical challenge due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and frequent signal blockages. These effects can easily introduce large outliers into the raw pseudo-range measurements, which significantly degrade the performance of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning and limit the effectiveness of tightly coupled GNSS-based integrated navigation system. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage outlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK, inertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor graph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed to detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less sensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a more stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second stage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints are used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements, which enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers. By combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved robustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite measuring quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage detection framework significantly reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers, and leads to improved positioning accuracy and consistency compared with representative baseline approaches. In the deep urban canyon test, the outlier mitigation method has limits the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion from 0.52 m to 0.30 m, with 42.3% improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Indoor/Outdoor Spectrum Sharing Enabled by GNSS-based Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26500v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing, between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi) data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy, showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM) 2025</p></details> |

Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).</p></details> |  |
| **[SwarmRaft: Leveraging Consensus for Robust Drone Swarm Coordination in GNSS-Degraded Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00622v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly used in critical applications such as aerial mapping, environmental monitoring, and autonomous delivery. However, the reliability of these systems is highly dependent on uninterrupted access to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, which can be disrupted in real-world scenarios due to interference, environmental conditions, or adversarial attacks, causing disorientation, collision risks, and mission failure. This paper proposes SwarmRaft, a blockchain-inspired positioning and consensus framework for maintaining coordination and data integrity in UAV swarms operating under GNSS-denied conditions. SwarmRaft leverages the Raft consensus algorithm to enable distributed drones (nodes) to agree on state updates such as location and heading, even in the absence of GNSS signals for one or more nodes. In our prototype, each node uses GNSS and local sensing, and communicates over WiFi in a simulated swarm. Upon signal loss, consensus is used to reconstruct or verify the position of the failed node based on its last known state and trajectory. Our system demonstrates robustness in maintaining swarm coherence and fault tolerance through a lightweight, scalable communication model. This work offers a practical and secure foundation for decentralized drone operation in unpredictable environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Availability Integrity Monitoring for Multi-Constellation GNSS Navigation with Non-Gaussian Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04284v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are essential for aviation, requiring strict integrity monitoring to alert users to hazardously misleading information. Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and advanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal errors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors with heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper proposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple simultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity monitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically exploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A tight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of hypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is examined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated based on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in existing research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical protection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than 50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings, baseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism induced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the proposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal operations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit. These improvements have promising potential to support localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) with a decision height of 200 ft, enhancing integrity and availability for multi-constellation GNSS applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Aerospace Systems</p></details> |

However, existing retrieval-based approaches face limitations in dataset availability and persistent challenges including suboptimal real-time performance, environmental sensitivity, and limited generalization capability, particularly in dynamic or temporally varying environments. To overcome these limitations, we present a large-scale Multi-Altitude Flight Segments dataset (MAFS) for variable altitude scenarios and propose a novel Semantic-Weighted Adaptive Particle Filter (SWA-PF) method. This approach integrates robust semantic features from both UAV-captured images and satellite imagery through two key innovations: a semantic weighting mechanism and an optimized particle filtering architecture. Evaluated using our dataset, the proposed method achieves 10x computational efficiency gain over feature extraction methods, maintains global positioning errors below 10 meters, and enables rapid 4 degree of freedom (4-DoF) pose estimation within seconds using accessible low-resolution satellite maps.

| **[Deep Temporal Graph Networks for Real-Time Correction of GNSS Jamming-Induced Deviations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14000v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are increasingly disrupted by intentional jamming, degrading availability precisely when positioning and timing must remain operational. We address this by reframing jamming mitigation as dynamic graph regression and introducing a receiver-centric deep temporal graph network that predicts, and thus corrects, the receivers horizontal deviation in real time. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite receiver environment is represented as a heterogeneous star graph (receiver center, tracked satellites as leaves) with time varying attributes (e.g., SNR, azimuth, elevation, latitude/longitude). A single layer Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM (HeteroGCLSTM) aggregates one hop spatial context and temporal dynamics over a short history to output the 2D deviation vector applied for on the fly correction. We evaluate on datasets from two distinct receivers under three jammer profiles, continuous wave (cw), triple tone (cw3), and wideband FM, each exercised at six power levels between -45 and -70 dBm, with 50 repetitions per scenario (prejam/jam/recovery). Against strong multivariate time series baselines (MLP, uniform CNN, and Seq2Point CNN), our model consistently attains the lowest mean absolute error (MAE). At -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64 cm (GP01/cw), 7.74 cm (GP01/cw3), 4.41 cm (ublox/cw), 4.84 cm (ublox/cw3), and 4.82 cm (ublox/FM), improving to 1.65-2.08 cm by -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed mode datasets pooling all powers, MAE is 3.78 cm (GP01) and 4.25 cm (ublox10), outperforming Seq2Point, MLP, and CNN. A split study shows superior data efficiency: with only 10\% training data our approach remains well ahead of baselines (20 cm vs. 36-42 cm).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Existing methods suffer from significant localization errors among UAVs due to packet loss and high computational complexity in large swarms. This paper proposes a clustering-based framework where the UAVs simultaneously use communication signals for channel estimation and ranging. Firstly, the spectral clustering is utilized to divide the UAV swarm into different sub-clusters, where matrix completion and multidimensional scaling yield high-precision relative coordinates. Subsequently, a global map is created by the inter-cluster anchor fusion. A case study of UAV integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) system is presented, where the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is adopted for ranging and communication.

| **[Joint Contact Planning for Navigation and Communication in GNSS-Libration Point Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20479v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying satellites at Earth-Moon Libration Points (LPs) addresses the inherent deep-space coverage gaps of low-altitude GNSS constellations. Integrating LP satellites with GNSS into a joint constellation enables a more robust and comprehensive Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) system, while also extending navigation and communication services to spacecraft operating in cislunar space (i.e., users). However, the long propagation delays between LP satellites, users, and GNSS satellites result in significantly different link durations compared to those within the GNSS constellation. Scheduling inter-satellite links (ISLs) is a core task of Contact Plan Design (CPD). Existing CPD approaches focus exclusively on GNSS constellations, assuming uniform link durations, and thus cannot accommodate the heterogeneous link timescales present in a joint GNSS-LP system. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Joint CPD (J-CPD) scheme tailored to handle ISLs with differing duration units across integrated constellations. The key contributions of J-CPD are: (i):introduction of LongSlots (Earth-Moon scale links) and ShortSlots (GNSS-scale links); (ii):a hierarchical and crossed CPD process for scheduling LongSlots and ShortSlots ISLs; (iii):an energy-driven link scheduling algorithm adapted to the CPD process. Simulations on a joint BeiDou-LP constellation demonstrate that J-CPD surpasses the baseline FCP method in both delay and ranging coverage, while maintaining high user satisfaction and enabling tunable trade-offs through adjustable potential-energy parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first CPD framework to jointly optimize navigation and communication in GNSS-LP systems, representing a key step toward unified and resilient deep-space PNT architectures.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

Five main contributions are made. First, a survey of flown and upcoming DSS missions with stringent precision requirements is conducted, from which a thorough requirements analysis is distilled to guide development and testing. Second, a real-time navigation functional architecture is designed, and adopts a sparse and regularized Consider Kalman Filter with options for numerical stability in-flight. The filter rigorously accounts for uncertainties in process noise, measurement noise, and biases. It tracks float ambiguities with integer resolution where possible. The covariance correlation structure is preserved under all navigation modes, including contingencies and outages. Third, a lightweight, memoryless Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) module is developed to guard against anomalous measurements, providing statistical screening and ensuring robust navigation. Fourth, the software architecture is proposed for ease of integration, with strategies presented for modularity and computational efficiency tailored to constrained flight systems. Fifth, a comprehensive test campaign is conducted, mapped to a requirements verification matrix, spanning unit, interface, software-in-the-loop, and real-time hardware-in-the-loop tests, emphasizing gradual test fidelity for efficient fault isolation. Finally, flight-like results are demonstrated using the VISORS mission, due to the generalizability of the VISORS navigation operations, and the stringency which demands sub-centimeter relative position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy. This architecture aims to serve as a reference for next-generation DSS missions adopting CDGNSS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Classical Hybrid Framework for Zero-Day Time-Push GNSS Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18085v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks, where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day, unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE Internet of Things Journal for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-view Landmark Representation Approach with Application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05368v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNSS Jammer and Spoofer Mitigation via Multi-Antenna Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18166v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern positioning relies on radio signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Their low receive power renders these radio signals susceptible to jamming attacks, in which malicious transmitters emit strong interference to disrupt signal acquisition. Moreover, GNSS are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, in which malicious transmitters mimic legitimate satellites by transmitting spurious GNSS signals. We propose SCHIEBER, a novel method for multi-antenna GNSS receivers that mitigates jammers as well as spoofers without requiring any prior knowledge of the receiver position or attack type: Jammers are mitigated during signal acquisition using a recently developed adaptive spatial filtering technique. Spoofers are identified and rejected after signal acquisition using a novel approach that tests the consistency of acquired signals by comparing their respective direction of arrival (DoA) and pseudorange estimates in a test that is invariant with respect to the unknown receiver position. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using extensive simulations of a GPS L1 C/A system under spoofing and jamming attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Robust 5G Terrestrial Positioning System with Sensor Fusion in GNSS-denied Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16600v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a terrestrial localization system based on 5G infrastructure as a viable alternative to GNSS, particularly in scenarios where GNSS signals are obstructed or unavailable. It discusses network planning aimed at enabling positioning as a primary service, in contrast to the traditional focus on communication services in terrestrial networks. Building on a network infrastructure optimized for positioning, the paper proposes a system that leverages carrier phase (CP) ranging in combination with trilateration to localize the user within the network when at least three base stations (BSs) provide line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Achieving accurate CP-based positioning requires addressing three key challenges: integer ambiguity resolution, LOS/NLOS link identification, and localization under obstructed LOS conditions. To this end, the system employs a multi-carrier CP approach, which eliminates the need for explicit integer ambiguity estimation. Additionally, a deep learning model is developed to identify NLOS links and exclude them from the trilateration process. In cases where LOS is obstructed and CP ranging becomes unreliable, the system incorporates an error-state extended Kalman filter to fuse complementary data from other sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and cameras. This hybrid approach enables robust tracking of moving users across diverse channel conditions. The performance of the proposed terrestrial positioning system is evaluated using the real-world KITTI dataset, featuring a moving vehicle in an urban environment. Simulation results show that the system can achieve a positioning error of less than 5 meters in the KITTI urban scenario--comparable to that of public commercial GNSS services--highlighting its potential as a resilient and accurate solution for GNSS-denied environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |

Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Real-Time Bayesian Detection of Drift-Evasive GNSS Spoofing in Reinforcement Learning Based UAV Deconfliction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11173v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements for accurate real-time localization and navigation. However, this dependence exposes them to sophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to deceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly perturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without triggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional distributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a threshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and timely response. Consequently, robust temporal-scale detection methods are essential to identify attack onset and enable contingency planning with alternative sensing modalities, improving resilience against stealthy adversarial manipulations. This study explores a Bayesian online change point detection (BOCPD) approach that monitors temporal shifts in value estimates from a reinforcement learning (RL) critic network to detect subtle behavioural deviations in UAV navigation. Experimental results show that this temporal value-based framework outperforms conventional GNSS spoofing detectors, temporal semi-supervised learning frameworks, and the Page-Hinkley test, achieving higher detection accuracy and lower false-positive and false-negative rates for drift-evasive spoofing attacks.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000 frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy. Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m, achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method, and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released publicly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Preparing to submit to International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation</p></details> |
| **[Joint Optimization-based Targetless Extrinsic Calibration for Multiple LiDARs and GNSS-Aided INS of Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08349v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geo-Registration of Terrestrial LiDAR Point Clouds with Satellite Images without GNSS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05999v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection. However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a 55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\% improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience & Remote Sensing.

Road network data can be used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29% decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine the user position on Earth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 workshop ML4Wireless</p></details> |

This paper proposes a cost-effective, vision-based multi-sensor navigation system that integrates monocular depth estimation, semantic filtering, and visual map registration (VMR) with 3-D digital maps. Extensive testing in real-world indoor and outdoor driving scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system, achieving sub-meter accuracy of 92% indoors and more than 80% outdoors, with consistent horizontal positioning and heading average root mean-square errors of approximately 0.98 m and 1.25 {\deg}, respectively. Compared to the baselines examined, the proposed solution significantly reduced drift and improved robustness under various conditions, achieving positioning accuracy improvements of approximately 88% on average. This work highlights the potential of cost-effective monocular vision systems combined with 3D maps for scalable, GNSS-independent navigation in land vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNSS Spoofing Detection Based on Opportunistic Position Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12580v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limited or no protection for civilian Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals makes spoofing attacks relatively easy. With modern mobile devices often featuring network interfaces, state-of-the-art signals of opportunity (SOP) schemes can provide accurate network positions in replacement of GNSS. The use of onboard inertial sensors can also assist in the absence of GNSS, possibly in the presence of jammers. The combination of SOP and inertial sensors has received limited attention, yet it shows strong results on fully custom-built platforms. We do not seek to improve such special-purpose schemes. Rather, we focus on countering GNSS attacks, notably detecting them, with emphasis on deployment with consumer-grade platforms, notably smartphones, that provide off-the-shelf opportunistic information (i.e., network position and inertial sensor data). Our Position-based Attack Detection Scheme (PADS) is a probabilistic framework that uses regression and uncertainty analysis for positions. The regression optimization problem is a weighted mean square error of polynomial fitting, with constraints that the fitted positions satisfy the device velocity and acceleration. Then, uncertainty is modeled by a Gaussian process, which provides more flexibility to analyze how sure or unsure we are about position estimations. In the detection process, we combine all uncertainty information with the position estimations into a fused test statistic, which is the input utilized by an anomaly detector based on outlier ensembles. The evaluation shows that the PADS outperforms a set of baseline methods that rely on SOP or inertial sensor-based or statistical tests, achieving up to 3 times the true positive rate at a low false positive rate.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, RA-L submission</p></details> |

This paper proposes a method to realize state estimation of dump truck position, orientation and articulation angle using multiple GNSS for automatic operation of dump trucks. RTK-GNSS is commonly used for automation of construction equipment, but in mountainous areas, mobile networks often unstable, and RTK-GNSS using GNSS reference stations cannot be used. Therefore, this paper develops a state estimation method for dump trucks that does not require a GNSS reference station by using the Centimeter Level Augmentation Service (CLAS) of the Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS). Although CLAS is capable of centimeter-level position estimation, its positioning accuracy and ambiguity fix rate are lower than those of RTK-GNSS. To solve this problem, we construct a state estimation method by factor graph optimization that combines CLAS positioning and moving-base RTK-GNSS between multiple GNSS antennas. Evaluation tests under real-world environments have shown that the proposed method can estimate the state of dump trucks with the same accuracy as conventional RTK-GNSS, but does not require a GNSS reference station.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ION 2024 Pacific PNT Meeting</p></details> |

The method is motivated by suboptimal performance in dense urban environments where the direct line of sight to GNSS satellites is often obscured which leads to multipath propagation of GNSS signals. The presented concept is based upon the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) and has linear complexity (with respect to the number of GNSS measurements) as opposed to some other techniques mitigating the multipath signal propagation. The technique is demonstrated both on a simulated example and real data. The root-mean-squared errors from the simulated ground truth positions show that the presented solution is able to improve performance compared to a baseline localization approach. Similar result is achieved for the experiment with real data, while treating orthogonal projections onto the tram track as the true position, which is unavailable in the realistic scenario. This proof-of-concept shows results which may be further improved with implementation of a bank-of-models method or $\chi^2$-based rejection of outlying GNSS pseudorange measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to European Control Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a novel tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to estimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3) an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities.

Unlike indoor settings, these agricultural environments possess additional challenges due to outdoor variables such as foliage motion and illumination variability. This paper proposes a solution based on 2D lidar measurements, which requires less processing and storage, and is more cost-effective, than approaches that employ 3D lidars. Utilizing the modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) metric, the method can solve the scan matching robustly and with high accuracy without needing sophisticated feature extraction. The method's robustness was validated using public datasets and considering various metrics, facilitating meaningful comparisons for future research. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly A-LOAM, show that the proposed approach achieves lower positional and angular errors while maintaining higher accuracy and resilience in GNSS-denied settings. This work contributes to the advancement of precision agriculture by enabling reliable and autonomous navigation in challenging outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

However, civilian GNSS signals are usually not cryptographically protected. This makes attacks that forge signals relatively easy. Considering modern devices often have network connections and onboard sensors, the proposed here Probabilistic Detection of GNSS Spoofing (PDS) scheme is based on such opportunistic information. PDS has at its core two parts. First, a regression problem with motion model constraints, which equalizes the noise of all locations considering the motion model of the device. Second, a Gaussian process, that analyzes statistical properties of location data to construct uncertainty. Then, a likelihood function, that fuses the two parts, as a basis for a Neyman-Pearson lemma (NPL)-based detection strategy. Our experimental evaluation shows a performance gain over the state-of-the-art, in terms of attack detection effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Federated GNSS Spoofing Detection with Opportunistic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06171v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, with adversarial signals manipulating the location or time information of receivers, potentially causing severe disruptions. The task of discerning the spoofing signals from benign ones is naturally relevant for machine learning, thus recent interest in applying it for detection. While deep learning-based methods are promising, they require extensive labeled datasets, consume significant computational resources, and raise privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of position data. This is why this paper proposes a self-supervised federated learning framework for GNSS spoofing detection. It consists of a cloud server and local mobile platforms. Each mobile platform employs a self-supervised anomaly detector using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Labels for training are generated locally through a spoofing-deviation prediction algorithm, ensuring privacy. Local models are trained independently, and only their parameters are uploaded to the cloud server, which aggregates them into a global model using FedAvg. The updated global model is then distributed back to the mobile platforms and trained iteratively. The evaluation shows that our self-supervised federated learning framework outperforms position-based and deep learning-based methods in detecting spoofing attacks while preserving data privacy.</p></details> |  |

Tunnels present a uniquely difficult scenario: they are not only prone to GNSS signal loss, but also provide little features for visual localization due to their repetitive walls and poor lighting. These conditions degrade conventional vision-based and LiDAR-based systems, which rely on distinguishable environmental features. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion framework that integrates a thermal camera with a LiDAR to enable robust localization in tunnels and other perceptually degraded environments. The thermal camera provides resilience in low-light or smoke conditions, while the LiDAR delivers precise depth perception and structural awareness. By combining these sensors, our framework ensures continuous and accurate localization across diverse and dynamic environments. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse multi-sensor inputs, and leverages visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to process the sensor data, enabling robust motion estimation and mapping even in GNSS-denied environments. This fusion of sensor modalities not only enhances system resilience but also provides a scalable solution for cyber-physical systems in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To validate the framework, we conduct tests in a tunnel environment, simulating sensor degradation and visibility challenges. The results demonstrate that our method sustains accurate localization where standard approaches deteriorate due to the tunnels featureless geometry. The frameworks versatility makes it a promising solution for autonomous vehicles, inspection robots, and other cyber-physical systems operating in constrained, perceptually poor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IAVVC 2025</p></details> |

While unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in greenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor placement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D camera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and utilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight of cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a harvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset, the proposed system achieves 94.4\% counting accuracy and 87.5\% weight estimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For the growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we qualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research directions for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of UAVs for efficient robotic yield estimation in commercial greenhouses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 ICRA workshop on field robotics</p></details> |

WR data which is automatically recorded by modern machinery equipped with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can enable efficient farm management decision making. Globally, farmers often rely on aged or legacy farming machinery and manual data recording, which introduces significant labor costs and increases the risk of inaccurate data input. To address this challenge, a field study in Central Japan was conducted to showcase automated data collection by retrofitting legacy farming machinery with low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For single-purpose vehicles (SPV), which only carry out single work types such as planting, LTE (Long Term Evolution) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) units were installed to record trajectory data. For multi-purpose vehicles (MPV), such as tractors which perform multiple work types, the configuration settings of these vehicles had to include implements and attachments data. To obtain this data, industry standard LTE-GNSS Bluetooth gateways were fitted onto MPV and low-cost BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons were attached to implements. After installation, over a seven-month field preparation and planting period 1,623 WR, including 421 WR for SPV and 1,120 WR for MVP, were automatically obtained. For MPV, the WR included detailed configuration settings enabling detection of the specific work types. These findings demonstrate the potential of low cost IoT GNSS devices for precision agriculture strategies to support management decisions in farming operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference proceedings (Extended Abstract) for the 14th Asian-Pacific Federation for Information Technology in Agriculture (APFITA), 6-8 November 2024, Tsukuba, Japan</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating ML Robustness in GNSS Interference Classification, Characterization & Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15114v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat, as they compromise the robustness of accurate positioning. The detection of anomalies within frequency snapshots is crucial to counteract these interferences effectively. A critical preliminary countermeasure involves the reliable classification of interferences and the characterization and localization of jamming devices. This paper introduces an extensive dataset comprising snapshots obtained from a low-frequency antenna that capture various generated interferences within a large-scale environment, including controlled multipath effects. Our objective is to assess the resilience of machine learning (ML) models against environmental changes, such as multipath effects, variations in interference attributes, such as interference class, bandwidth, and signal power, the accuracy of jamming device localization, and the constraints imposed by snapshot input lengths. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of a diverse set of 129 distinct vision encoder models across all tasks. By analyzing the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, we demonstrate the adaptability of our model in generalizing across diverse facets, thus establishing its suitability for real-world applications.

In light of this, conventional model-based positioning approaches, which rely on Gaussian error approximations, struggle to achieve precise localization under these conditions. To overcome these challenges, we put forth a novel learning-based framework, PC-DeepNet, that employs a permutation-invariant (PI) deep neural network (DNN) to estimate position corrections (PC). This approach is designed to ensure robustness against changes in the number and/or order of visible satellite measurements, a common issue in GNSS systems, while leveraging NLOS and multipath indicators as features to enhance positioning accuracy in challenging urban and sub-urban environments. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we compare the positioning error with state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based positioning methods using two publicly available datasets. The results confirm that proposed PC-DeepNet achieves superior accuracy than existing model-based and learning-based methods while exhibiting lower computational complexity compared to previous learning-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In the context of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) applications, the primary objective is to accurately monitor and classify interferences that degrade system performance in distributed environments, thereby enhancing situational awareness. To achieve this, machine learning (ML) models can be deployed on low-resource devices, ensuring minimal communication latency and preserving data privacy. The key challenge is to compress ML models while maintaining high classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose variational autoencoders (VAEs) for disentanglement to extract essential latent features that enable accurate classification of interferences. We demonstrate that the disentanglement approach can be leveraged for both data compression and data augmentation by interpolating the lower-dimensional latent representations of signal power. To validate our approach, we evaluate three VAE variants - vanilla, factorized, and conditional generative - on four distinct datasets, including two collected in controlled indoor environments and two real-world highway datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive hyperparameter searches to optimize performance. Our proposed VAE achieves a data compression rate ranging from 512 to 8,192 and achieves an accuracy up to 99.92%.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Towards Simple Machine Learning Baselines for GNSS RFI Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07993v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning research in GNSS radio frequency interference (RFI) detection often lacks a clear empirical justification for the choice of deep learning architectures over simpler machine learning approaches. In this work, we argue for a change in research direction-from developing ever more complex deep learning models to carefully assessing their real-world effectiveness in comparison to interpretable and lightweight machine learning baselines. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art deep learning models frequently fail to outperform simple, well-engineered machine learning methods in the context of GNSS RFI detection. Leveraging a unique large-scale dataset collected by the Swiss Air Force and Swiss Air-Rescue (Rega), and preprocessed by Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (Skyguide), we demonstrate that a simple baseline model achieves 91\% accuracy in detecting GNSS RFI, outperforming more complex deep learning counterparts. These results highlight the effectiveness of pragmatic solutions and offer valuable insights to guide future research in this critical application domain.</p></details> |  |

To achieve accurate positioning, vehicles typically use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers to validate their absolute positions. However, GNSS-based positioning can be compromised by interference signals, necessitating the identification, classification, determination of purpose, and localization of such interference to mitigate or eliminate it. Recent approaches based on machine learning (ML) have shown superior performance in monitoring interference. However, their feasibility in real-world applications and environments has yet to be assessed. Effective implementation of ML techniques requires training datasets that incorporate realistic interference signals, including real-world noise and potential multipath effects that may occur between transmitter, receiver, and satellite in the operational area. Additionally, these datasets require reference labels. Creating such datasets is often challenging due to legal restrictions, as causing interference to GNSS sources is strictly prohibited. Consequently, the performance of ML-based methods in practical applications remains unclear. To address this gap, we describe a series of large-scale measurement campaigns conducted in real-world settings at two highway locations in Germany and the Seetal Alps in Austria, and in large-scale controlled indoor environments. We evaluate the latest supervised ML-based methods to report on their performance in real-world settings and present the applicability of pseudo-labeling for unsupervised learning. We demonstrate the challenges of combining datasets due to data discrepancies and evaluate outlier detection, domain adaptation, and data augmentation techniques to present the models' capabilities to adapt to changes in the datasets.</p></details> | 34 pages, 25 figures |

We validate the proposed learning-based models using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Experimental results demonstrate that both models effectively handle GNSS outliers and improve state estimation performance.

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Cross-checking the GNSS-provided time against alternative multiple trusted time sources can lead to attack detection aiming at controlling the GNSS receiver time. Leveraging external, network-connected secure time providers and onboard clock references, we achieve detection even under fine-grained time attacks. We provide an extensive evaluation of our multi-layered defense against adversaries mounting attacks against the GNSS receiver along with controlling the network link. We implement adversaries spanning from simplistic spoofers to advanced ones synchronized with the GNSS constellation. We demonstrate attack detection is possible in all tested cases (sharp discontinuity, smooth take-over, and coordinated network manipulation) without changes to the structure of the GNSS receiver. Leveraging the diversity of the reference time sources, detection of take-over time push as low as 150us is possible. Smooth take-overs forcing variations as low as 30ns are also detected based on on-board precision oscillators. The method (and thus the evaluation) is largely agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker type, making time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with existing receivers and readily deployable.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (Early Access)</p></details> |

FGO exhibits superior estimation accuracy compared with traditional state estimation methods that rely on least-squares or Kalman filters. However, only a few FGO libraries are specialized for GNSS observations. This paper introduces an open-source GNSS FGO package named gtsam\_gnss, which has a simple structure and can be easily applied to GNSS research and development. This package separates the preprocessing of GNSS observations from factor optimization. Moreover, it describes the error function of the GNSS factor in a straightforward manner, allowing for general-purpose inputs. This design facilitates the transition from ordinary least-squares-based positioning to FGO and supports user-specific GNSS research. In addition, gtsam\_gnss includes analytical examples involving various factors using GNSS data in real urban environments. This paper presents three application examples: the use of a robust error model, estimation of integer ambiguity in the carrier phase, and combination of GNSS and inertial measurements from smartphones. The proposed framework demonstrates excellent state estimation performance across all use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)</p></details> |
| **[Consumer INS Coupled with Carrier Phase Measurements for GNSS Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03870v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems enable precise localization and timing even for highly mobile devices, but legacy implementations provide only limited support for the new generation of security-enhanced signals. Inertial Measurement Units have proved successful in augmenting the accuracy and robustness of the GNSS-provided navigation solution, but effective navigation based on inertial techniques in denied contexts requires high-end sensors. However, commercially available mobile devices usually embed a much lower-grade inertial system. To counteract an attacker transmitting all the adversarial signals from a single antenna, we exploit carrier phase-based observations coupled with a low-end inertial sensor to identify spoofing and meaconing. By short-time integration with an inertial platform, which tracks the displacement of the GNSS antenna, the high-frequency movement at the receiver is correlated with the variation in the carrier phase. In this way, we identify legitimate transmitters, based on their geometrical diversity with respect to the antenna system movement. We introduce a platform designed to effectively compare different tiers of commercial INS platforms with a GNSS receiver. By characterizing different inertial sensors, we show that simple MEMS INS perform as well as high-end industrial-grade sensors. Sensors traditionally considered unsuited for navigation purposes offer great performance at the short integration times used to evaluate the carrier phase information consistency against the high-frequency movement. Results from laboratory evaluation and through field tests at Jammertest 2024 show that the detector is up to 90% accurate in correctly identifying spoofing (or the lack of it), without any modification to the receiver structure, and with mass-production grade INS typical for mobile phones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ION ITM/PTTI 2025</p></details> |

This system works with a heterogeneous system consisting of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to perform inspection and intervention tasks in GNSS-denied or interrupted environments. The carrier, an electric catamaran measuring 4m by 7m, features a 4m by 6m deck supporting automated takeoff and landing for four DJI M300 drones, along with a 10kg-payload manipulator operable in up to level 3 sea conditions. Utilizing an offshore gimbal camera for navigation, the carrier can autonomously navigate, approach and dock with non-cooperative vessels, guided by an onboard camera, LiDAR, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) over a 3 km$^2$ area. UAVs equipped with onboard Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology execute mapping, detection, and manipulation tasks using a versatile gripper designed for wet, saline conditions. Additionally, two UAVs can coordinate to transport large objects to the manipulator or interact directly with them. These procedures are fully automated and were successfully demonstrated at the Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robotic Competition (MBZIRC2024), where the drone carrier equipped with four UAVS and one manipulator, automatically accomplished the intervention tasks in sea-level-3 (wave height 1.25m) based on the rough target information.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12pages |

Given the inherent limitations of standalone sensors, integrating heterogeneous sensors with complementary capabilities is one of the most effective approaches to achieving this goal. In this paper, we propose a filtering-based, tightly coupled global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-visual-inertial positioning framework with a pose-only formulation applied to the visual-inertial system (VINS), termed PO-GVINS. Specifically, multiple-view imaging used in current VINS requires a priori of 3D feature, then jointly estimate camera poses and 3D feature position, which inevitably introduces linearization error of the feature as well as facing dimensional explosion. However, the pose-only (PO) formulation, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to the multiple-view imaging and has been applied in visual reconstruction, represent feature depth using two camera poses and thus 3D feature position is removed from state vector avoiding aforementioned difficulties. Inspired by this, we first apply PO formulation in our VINS, i.e., PO-VINS. GNSS raw measurements are then incorporated with integer ambiguity resolved to achieve accurate and drift-free estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PO-VINS significantly outperforms the multi-state constrained Kalman filter (MSCKF). By incorporating GNSS measurements, PO-GVINS achieves accurate, drift-free state estimation, making it a robust solution for positioning in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown the significant advantages of the wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning system. However, it still drifts over extended periods because of the absence of external correction signals. To achieve the goal of long-term accurate localization, we propose Wheel-GINS, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation system using a Wheel-IMU. Wheel-GINS fuses the GNSS position measurement with the Wheel-IMU via an extended Kalman filter to limit the long-term error drift and provide continuous state estimation when the GNSS signal is blocked. Considering the specificities of the GNSS/Wheel-IMU integration, we conduct detailed modeling and online estimation of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting angle and the wheel radius error. Experimental results have shown that Wheel-GINS outperforms the traditional GNSS/Odometer/INS integrated navigation system during GNSS outages. At the same time, Wheel-GINS can effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU installation parameters online and, consequently, improve the localization accuracy and practicality of the system.

As the backbone for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) across various applications including transportation, telecommunications, and emergency services GNSS is vulnerable to deliberate interference that poses significant risks. Spoofing attacks, which involve transmitting counterfeit GNSS signals to mislead receivers into calculating incorrect positions, can result in serious consequences, from navigational errors in civilian aviation to security breaches in military operations. Furthermore, the lack of inherent security measures within GNSS systems makes them attractive targets for adversaries. While GNSS/GPS jamming and spoofing systems consist of numerous components, the ability to distinguish authentic signals from malicious ones is essential for maintaining system integrity. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning provide promising avenues for enhancing detection and mitigation strategies against these threats. This paper addresses both spoofing and jamming by tackling real-world challenges through machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets related to spoofing and jamming detection using advanced algorithms, we achieved state of the art results. In the GNSS/GPS jamming detection task, we attained approximately 99% accuracy, improving performance by around 5% compared to previous studies. Additionally, we addressed a challenging tasks related to spoofing detection, yielding results that underscore the potential of machine learning and deep learning in this domain.</p></details> |  |

While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

Recent research extends scene graphs to hierarchical layers, adding and leveraging constraints across these levels. This approach is tightly integrated with pose-graph optimization, improving both localization and mapping accuracy simultaneously. However, when segmenting spatial characteristics, consistently recognizing rooms becomes challenging due to variations in viewpoints and limited field of view (FOV) of sensors. For example, existing real-time approaches often over-segment large rooms into smaller, non-functional spaces that are not useful for localization and mapping due to the time-dependent method. Conversely, their voxel-based room segmentation method often under-segment in complex cases like not fully enclosed 3D space that are non-traversable for ground robots or humans, leading to false constraints in pose-graph optimization. We propose a traversability-aware room segmentation method that considers the interaction between robots and surroundings, with consistent feasibility of traversability information. This enhances both the semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization. Improved performance is demonstrated through the re-detection frequency of the same rooms in a dataset involving repeated traversals of the same space along the same path, as well as the optimization time consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RiTA 2024</p></details> |
| **[TACS-Graphs: Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs for Ground Robot Localization and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14178v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for robots, providing a structured representation of spatial and semantic relationships for advanced task planning. Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs face critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room layers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies non-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while over-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex environments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that rely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of traversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle segmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework that integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By leveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the proposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically coherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based scene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced segmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the proposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD) leading to higher pose estimation accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scene graph consistency and pose graph optimization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

We present FLARKO (Financial Language-model for Asset Recommendation with Knowledge-graph Optimization), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to generate asset recommendations that are both profitable and behaviorally aligned. FLARKO encodes users' transaction histories and asset trends as structured KGs, providing interpretable and controllable context for the LLM. To demonstrate the adaptability of our approach, we develop and evaluate both a centralized architecture (CenFLARKO) and a federated variant (FedFLARKO). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of combining KTO for fine-tuning of LLMs for financial asset recommendation. We also present the first use of structured KGs to ground LLM reasoning over behavioral financial data in a federated learning (FL) setting. Evaluated on the FAR-Trans dataset, FLARKO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines on behavioral alignment and joint profitability, while remaining interpretable and resource-efficient.</p></details> |  |

Unlike standard GNNs that rely on shallow, fixed-hop aggregation, DRTR leverages both static preprocessing and dynamic resampling to capture deeper structural dependencies. A \emph{Distance Recomputator} prunes semantically weak edges using adaptive attention, while a \emph{Topology Reconstructor} establishes latent connections among distant but relevant nodes. This joint mechanism enables more expressive and robust representation learning across evolving graph structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRTR outperforms baseline GNNs in both accuracy and scalability, especially in complex and noisy graph environments.</p></details> |  |

Classic routing formulations such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) represent fundamental graph optimization challenges. Recent data-driven optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization (VAGPO) approach. By leveraging ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient methods. Experimental results on generated TSP and CVRP instances, as well as real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed VAGPO approach achieves highly competitive solution quality. Additionally, VAGPO exhibits strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on positioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their observability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly coupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable factor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and ambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion, while vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over state-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer positioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error of 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent improvement. To foster further research, we also release the first open-source dataset that combines IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from both rover and base stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

Scene Graph-Aware Deep Point Cloud Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08512v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems, especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes, enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging, achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained with raw LiDAR scans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L). 8 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved two-block coordinate descent method for Pose Graph Optimization Problem under $F^*$-norm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17251v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dual quaternions and dual quaternion matrices are widely used in robotics research, particularly in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Using dual quaternion theory and graph-based methods, SLAM can be reformulated as a rank-one dual quaternion Hermitian matrix completion problem, known as the pose graph optimization (PGO) problem. Recently, Qi and Cui introduced a two-block coordinate descent method to solve this reformulated problem. In this paper, we enhance this method by reformulating the PGO problem under the more appropriate and robust F*-norm rather than the conventional Frobenius norm, leading to improved experimental accuracy. We show that under the F*-norm, one block has a closed-form solution and another is the optimal rank-one approximation of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices under the F*-norm. We derive an explicit solution for this approximation and present an efficient algorithm to compute it. To further enhance the two-block coordinate descent method, we introduce proper parameter selection, stagnation-based termination criteria and an effective spectral initialization strategy. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our refinements deliver superior accuracy, faster computation, and higher success rates, particularly in low-observation settings. In particular, using the F*-norm outperforms the traditional F-norm, underscoring its ability to more faithfully capture the magnitude of the dual parts of dual quaternion matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.12635</p></details> |
| **[A Stochastic Framework for Continuous-Time State Estimation of Continuum Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01381v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations, or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process (GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity, and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space. This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures.

Neural constitutive models (NCMs) offer a highly expressive and flexible framework for modeling complex material behavior in solid mechanics. However, their practical adoption in large-scale FE simulations remains limited due to significant computational costs, especially in repeatedly evaluating stress and stiffness. NCMs thus represent an extreme case: their large computational graphs make stress and stiffness evaluations prohibitively expensive, restricting their use to small-scale problems. In this work, we introduce COMMET, an open-source FE framework whose architecture has been redesigned from the ground up to accelerate high-cost constitutive updates. Our framework features a novel assembly algorithm that supports batched and vectorized constitutive evaluations, compute-graph-optimized derivatives that replace automatic differentiation, and distributed-memory parallelism via MPI. These advances dramatically reduce runtime, with speed-ups exceeding three orders of magnitude relative to traditional non-vectorized automatic differentiation-based implementations. While we demonstrate these gains primarily for NCMs, the same principles apply broadly wherever for-loop based assembly or constitutive updates limit performance, establishing a new standard for large-scale, high-fidelity simulations in computational mechanics.</p></details> | 40 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Two stage GNSS outlier detection for factor graph optimization based GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00524v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable GNSS positioning in complex environments remains a critical challenge due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and frequent signal blockages. These effects can easily introduce large outliers into the raw pseudo-range measurements, which significantly degrade the performance of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning and limit the effectiveness of tightly coupled GNSS-based integrated navigation system. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage outlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK, inertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor graph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed to detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less sensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a more stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second stage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints are used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements, which enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers. By combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved robustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite measuring quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage detection framework significantly reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers, and leads to improved positioning accuracy and consistency compared with representative baseline approaches. In the deep urban canyon test, the outlier mitigation method has limits the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion from 0.52 m to 0.30 m, with 42.3% improvement.</p></details> |  |

It provides a CUDA C++ interface to enable the sharing of code between a realtime application, such as a SLAM system, and its optimization tasks. The framework supports techniques to reduce memory usage, including in-place optimization, support for multiple floating point types and mixed-precision modes, and dynamically computed Jacobians. We evaluate Graphite on well-known bundle adjustment problems and find that it achieves similar performance to MegBA, a solver specialized for bundle adjustment, while maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global visual-inertial bundle adjustment on maps generated from stereo-inertial SLAM datasets, and observe speed ups of up to 59x compared to a CPU baseline. Our results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on both desktop and resource-constrained devices.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Foundation Models: Bridging Language Model Paradigms and Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24256v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for applying foundation model innovations to OR.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360 images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion 0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.</p></details> |  |

For a radar-LiDAR sensor pair with equal rates, this strategy results in a state creation rate of twice the individual sensor frequencies. This doubling of the number of states per second yields high optimization costs, inhibiting real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware. We introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate inertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar measurement timestamp. This strategy maintains the node creation rate at the LiDAR measurement frequency. Assuming equal sensor rates, this lowers the number of nodes by 50 % and consequently the computational costs. Experiments on a single board computer (which has 4 cores each of 2.2 GHz A73 and 2 GHz A53 with 8 GB RAM) show that our method preserves the absolute pose error of a conventional baseline while simultaneously lowering the aggregated factor graph optimization time by up to 56 %.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, accepted by The 22nd International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR 2025).

It generates complex vortices that induce destabilizing suction forces, potentially leading to hazardous vibrations or collisions. This paper presents a comprehensive solution featuring (1) a physics-based suction force model that explicitly characterizes the dependency on both rotor speed and wall distance, and (2) a suction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework designed to ensure accurate and stable trajectory tracking during wall-proximity operations. The proposed SC-MPC framework incorporates an enhanced dynamics model that accounts for suction force effects, formulated as a factor graph optimization problem integrating system dynamics constraints, trajectory tracking objectives, control input smoothness requirements, and actuator physical limitations. The suction force model parameters are systematically identified through extensive experimental measurements across varying operational conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates SC-MPC's superior performance, achieving 2.1 cm root mean squared error (RMSE) in X-axis and 2.0 cm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and 60% and 53% improvements over standard MPC respectively. The corresponding mean absolute error (MAE) metrics (1.2 cm X-axis, 1.4 cm Y-axis) similarly outperform both baselines. The evaluation platform employs a ducted quadrotor design that provides collision protection while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. To facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we have open-sourced our complete implementation, available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SC-MPC-6A61.</p></details> |  |

For given a digraph $D$, we use $P(D)$ for the set of ordered pairs of distinct vertices in $V(D)$ and we define $\kappa_D:P(D)\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ by $\kappa_D(u,v)=1$ if $v$ is reachable from $u$ in $D$, and $\kappa_D(u,v)=0$, otherwise. We use $R(D)=\sum_{(u,v)\in P(D)}\kappa_D(u,v)$. Now, given a mixed graph $G$, we aim to find an orientation $\vec{G}$ of $G$ that maximizes $R(\vec{G})$. Hakimi, Schmeichel, and Young proved that the problem can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to undirected inputs. They inquired about the complexity in mixed graphs. We answer this question by showing that this problem is NP-hard, and, moreover, APX-hard. We then develop a finer understanding of how quickly the problem becomes difficult when going from undirected to mixed graphs. To this end, we consider the parameterized complexity of the problem with respect to the number $k$ of preoriented arcs of $G$, a poorly understood form of parameterization. We show that the problem can be solved in time $n^{O(k)}$ and that a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation can be computed in time $f(k,\epsilon)n^{O(1)}$ for any $\epsilon > 0$.</p></details> |  |

Our paper is the first to explore the use of factor graph optimization techniques for leak localization in water distribution networks, enabling us to perform sensor fusion between pressure and demand sensor readings and to estimate the network's temporal and structural state evolution across all network nodes. The methodology introduces specific water network factors and proposes a new architecture composed of two factor graphs: a leak-free state estimation factor graph and a leak localization factor graph. When a new sensor reading is obtained, unlike Kalman and other interpolation-based methods, which estimate only the current network state, factor graphs update both current and past states. Results on Modena, L-TOWN and synthetic networks show that factor graphs are much faster than nonlinear Kalman-based alternatives such as the UKF, while also providing improvements in localization compared to state-of-the-art estimation-localization approaches. Implementation and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/pirofti/FGLL.</p></details> |  |

Prior methods for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings, assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments. In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera poses.

| **[Robust simultaneous UWB-anchor calibration and robot localization for emergency situations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22272v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a factor graph optimization (FGO) framework to simultaneously solve the calibration problem for Ultra-WideBand (UWB) anchors and the robot localization problem. Calibrating UWB anchors manually can be time-consuming and even impossible in emergencies or those situations without special calibration tools. Therefore, automatic estimation of the anchor positions becomes a necessity. The proposed method enables the creation of a soft sensor providing the position information of the anchors in a UWB network. This soft sensor requires only UWB and LiDAR measurements measured from a moving robot. The proposed FGO framework is suitable for the calibration of an extendable large UWB network. Moreover, the anchor calibration problem and robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously, which saves time for UWB network deployment. The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial errors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and robustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot localization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. More specifically, the anchor calibration problem with four anchors and the robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously and automatically within 30 seconds by the proposed framework.

| **[ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy. However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network (SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers: SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy (0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Omics Analysis for Cancer Subtype Inference via Unrolling Graph Smoothness Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06257v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data. Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters. The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data (including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13 distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and 127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic, association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference, and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets, including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of 89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases, along with feedback-based learning from physician input.</p></details> |  |

For instance, when analyzing dynamic social networks, we may be interested in monitoring the evolution of a community that was identified at an earlier snapshot. This task requires finding a community in the current snapshot of data that is ``close'' to the earlier-discovered community of interest. However, classic optimization algorithms, which typically find solutions from scratch, potentially return communities that are very dissimilar to the initial one. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the \emph{OptiRefine framework}. The framework optimizes initial solutions by making a small number of \emph{refinements}, thereby ensuring that the new solution remains close to the initial solution and simultaneously achieving a near-optimal solution for the optimization problem. We apply the OptiRefine framework to two classic graph-optimization problems: \emph{densest subgraph} and \emph{maximum cut}. For the \emph{densest-subgraph problem}, we optimize a given subgraph's density by adding or removing $k$~nodes. We show that this novel problem is a generalization of $k$-densest subgraph, and provide constant-factor approximation algorithms for $k=\Omega(n)$~refinements. We also study a version of \emph{maximum cut} in which the goal is to improve a given cut. We provide connections to maximum cut with cardinality constraints and provide an optimal approximation algorithm in most parameter regimes under the Unique Games Conjecture for $k=\Omega(n)$~refinements. We evaluate our theoretical methods and scalable heuristics on synthetic and real-world data and show that they are highly effective in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 2025, final version</p></details> |

Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath, a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding, math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, under review for AAAI2026</p></details> |
| **[RiemanLine: Riemannian Manifold Representation of 3D Lines for Factor Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04335v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter dimensionality and improving convergence stability.</p></details> |  |

Traditional SLAM approaches, which often rely on visual or LiDAR sensors, face significant challenges in adverse conditions such as low light or featureless environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Doppler-aided radar-inertial and LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages the complementary strengths of 4D radar, FMCW LiDAR, and inertial measurement units. Our system integrates Doppler velocity measurements and spatial data into a tightly-coupled front-end and graph optimization back-end to provide enhanced ego velocity estimation, accurate odometry, and robust mapping. We also introduce a Doppler-based scan-matching technique to improve front-end odometry in dynamic environments. In addition, our framework incorporates an innovative online extrinsic calibration mechanism, utilizing Doppler velocity and loop closure to dynamically maintain sensor alignment. Extensive evaluations on both public and proprietary datasets show that our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art radar-SLAM and LiDAR-SLAM frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness. To encourage further research, the code of our Doppler-SLAM and our dataset are available at: https://github.com/Wayne-DWA/Doppler-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Flow Sensitivity without Control Flow Graph: An Efficient Andersen-Style Flow-Sensitive Pointer Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01974v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-sensitive pointer analysis constitutes an essential component of precise program analysis for accurately modeling pointer behaviors by incorporating control flows. Flow-sensitive pointer analysis is extensively used in alias analysis, taint analysis, program understanding, compiler optimization, etc. Existing flow-sensitive pointer analysis approaches, which are conducted based on control flow graphs, have significantly advanced the precision of pointer analysis via sophisticated techniques to leverage control flow information. However, they inevitably suffer from computational inefficiencies when resolving points-to information due to the inherent complex structures of control flow graphs. We present CG-FSPTA, a Flow-Sensitive Constraint Graph (FSConsG) based flow-sensitive pointer analysis to overcome the inefficiency of control-flow-graph-based analysis. CG-FSPTA uses a flow-sensitive variant to leverage the structural advantages of set-constraint graphs (which are commonly used in flow-insensitive pointer analysis) while keeping the flow sensitivity of variable definitions and uses, allowing the incorporation of sophisticated graph optimization and dynamic solving techniques. In this way, CG-FSPTA achieves significant efficiency improvements while keeping the precision of flow-sensitive analysis. Experimental evaluations on benchmark programs demonstrate that CG-FSPTA, significantly reduces both memory usage and execution time while maintaining precision. In particular, by solving in the FSConsG, CG-FSPTA achieves an average memory reduction of 33.05\% and accelerates flow-sensitive pointer analysis by 7.27x compared to the state-of-art method. These experimental results underscore the efficacy of CG-FSPTA as a scalable solution to analyze large-scale software systems, establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in efficient program analysis frameworks.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cycles Protocol: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Clearing System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22309v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For centuries, financial institutions have responded to liquidity challenges by forming closed, centralized clearing clubs with strict rules and membership that allow them to collaborate on using the least money to discharge the most debt. As closed clubs, much of the general public has been excluded from participation. But the vast majority of private sector actors consists of micro or small firms that are vulnerable to late payments and generally ineligible for bank loans. This low liquidity environment often results in gridlock and leads to insolvency, and it disproportionately impacts small enterprises and communities. On the other hand, blockchain communities have developed open, decentralized settlement systems, along with a proliferation of store of value assets and new lending protocols, allowing anyone to permissionlessly transact and access credit. However, these protocols remain used primarily for speculative purposes, and so far have fallen short of the large-scale positive impact on the real economy prophesied by their promoters. We address these challenges by introducing Cycles, an open, decentralized clearing, settlement, and issuance protocol. Cycles is designed to enable firms to overcome payment inefficiencies, to reduce their working capital costs, and to leverage diverse assets and liquidity sources, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and lending protocols, in service of clearing more debt with less money. Cycles solves real world liquidity challenges through a privacy-preserving multilateral settlement platform based on a graph optimization algorithm. The design is based on a core insight: liquidity resides within cycles in the payment network's structure and can be accessed via settlement flows optimized to reduce debt.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |

However, achieving a unified map robust to sensor modalities and dynamic environments remains a challenging problem. Variations in LiDAR types and dynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene consistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure detection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges, this paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging framework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal, dynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A voxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify and reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal module is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved static local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic environments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are conducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a centralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during map merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph optimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for globally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse real-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing superior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping in dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing methods.

However, environmental challenges such as smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather can significantly degrade the performance of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS, compromising the overall stability and safety of autonomous robots. To address these challenges, we propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D millimeter-wave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry estimation in complex environments. Our method consists of three key modules. Firstly, the pre-processing module utilizes radar data to assist LiDAR in removing dynamic points and determining when environmental conditions are degraded for LiDAR. Secondly, the dynamic-aware multimodal odometry selects appropriate point cloud data for scan-to-map matching and tightly couples it with the IMU using the Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. Lastly, the factor graph optimization module balances weights between odometry and GPS data, constructing a pose graph for optimization. The proposed approach has been evaluated on datasets and tested in real-world robotic environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over existing methods in challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating semantics provides a richer scene representation that not only enhances localization accuracy in SLAM but also enables advanced cognitive functionalities for downstream navigation and planning tasks. Existing point-wise semantic LiDAR SLAM methods often suffer from poor efficiency and generalization, making them less robust in diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a semantic graph-enhanced SLAM framework, named SG-SLAM, which effectively leverages the geometric, semantic, and topological characteristics inherent in environmental structures. The semantic graph serves as a fundamental component that facilitates critical functionalities of SLAM, including robust relocalization during odometry failures, accurate loop closing, and semantic graph map construction. Our method employs a dual-threaded architecture, with one thread dedicated to online odometry and relocalization, while the other handles loop closure, pose graph optimization, and map update. This design enables our method to operate in real time and generate globally consistent semantic graph maps and point cloud maps. We extensively evaluate our method across the KITTI, MulRAN, and Apollo datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods.

To address this, we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000 frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy. Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m, achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method, and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping in GNSS-constrained environments.

To reduce computational overhead, previous studies attempt to sparsify the graph or network parameters, but with limited flexibility and precision boundaries. In this work, we propose Unifews, a joint sparsification technique to unify graph and weight matrix operations and enhance GNN learning efficiency. The Unifews design enables adaptive compression across GNN layers with progressively increased sparsity, and is applicable to a variety of architectures with on-the-fly simplification. Theoretically, we establish a novel framework to characterize sparsified GNN learning in view of the graph optimization process, showing that Unifews effectively approximates the learning objective with bounded error and reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Unifews achieves efficiency improvements with comparable or better accuracy, including 10-20x matrix operation reduction and up to 100x acceleration on graphs up to billion-edge scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

The proposed method performs robust and accurate pose estimation within a continuous-time trajectory optimization framework, while incrementally reconstructing a 3D Gaussian map using camera and LiDAR data, all in real time. The resulting map enables high-quality, real-time novel view rendering of both RGB images and depth maps. To effectively address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas, significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence novel view synthesis. Both the dataset and code will be made publicly available on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic2.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of corresponding real-world datasets significantly hinders the development and evaluation of robust pose estimation models. This is largely attributed to the inherent challenges in accurately annotating object poses in dynamic scenes captured by moving cameras. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel dataset DynOPETs and a dedicated data acquisition and annotation pipeline tailored for object pose estimation and tracking in such unconstrained environments. Our efficient annotation method innovatively integrates pose estimation and pose tracking techniques to generate pseudo-labels, which are subsequently refined through pose graph optimization. The resulting dataset offers accurate pose annotations for dynamic objects observed from moving cameras. To validate the effectiveness and value of our dataset, we perform comprehensive evaluations using 18 state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential to accelerate research in this challenging domain. The dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate further exploration and advancement in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[CortexDebate: Debating Sparsely and Equally for Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03928v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate". Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results across eight datasets from four task types.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

This paper presents a novel approach to indoor exploration that addresses these key issues in existing methods. We introduce a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)-aware region-based exploration strategy that partitions the environment into discrete regions, allowing the robot to incrementally explore and stabilize each region before moving to the next one. This approach significantly reduces redundant exploration and improves overall efficiency. As the device finishes exploring a region and stabilizes it, we also perform SLAM keyframe marginalization, a technique which reduces problem complexity by eliminating variables, while preserving their essential information. To improves robustness and further enhance efficiency, we develop a checkpoint system that enables the robot to resume exploration from the last stable region in case of failures, eliminating the need for complete re-exploration. Our method, tested in real homes, office and simulations, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The improvements demonstrate substantial enhancements in various real world environments, with significant reductions in keyframe usage (85%), submap usage (50% office, 32% home), pose graph optimization time (78-80%), and exploration duration (10-15%).

Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework. Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[PG-LIO: Photometric-Geometric fusion for Robust LiDAR-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18583v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is widely used for accurate state estimation and mapping which is an essential requirement for autonomous robots. Conventional LIO methods typically rely on formulating constraints from the geometric structure sampled by the LiDAR. Hence, in the lack of geometric structure, these tend to become ill-conditioned (degenerate) and fail. Robustness of LIO to such conditions is a necessity for its broader deployment. To address this, we propose PG-LIO, a real-time LIO method that fuses photometric and geometric information sampled by the LiDAR along with inertial constraints from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This multi-modal information is integrated into a factor graph optimized over a sliding window for real-time operation. We evaluate PG-LIO on multiple datasets that include both geometrically well-conditioned as well as self-similar scenarios. Our method achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art LIO in geometrically well-structured settings while significantly improving accuracy in degenerate cases including against methods that also fuse intensity. Notably, we demonstrate only 1 m drift over a 1 km manually piloted aerial trajectory through a geometrically self-similar tunnel at an average speed of 7.5m/s (max speed 10.8 m/s). For the benefit of the community, we shall also release our source code https://github.com/ntnu-arl/mimosa</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Barrier Method for Inequality Constrained Factor Graph Optimization with Application to Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14341v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factor graphs have demonstrated remarkable efficiency for robotic perception tasks, particularly in localization and mapping applications. However, their application to optimal control problems -- especially Model Predictive Control (MPC) -- has remained limited due to fundamental challenges in constraint handling. This paper presents a novel integration of the Barrier Interior Point Method (BIPM) with factor graphs, implemented as an open-source extension to the widely adopted g2o framework. Our approach introduces specialized inequality factor nodes that encode logarithmic barrier functions, thereby overcoming the quadratic-form limitations of conventional factor graph formulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first g2o-based implementation capable of efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints within a unified optimization backend. We validate the method through a multi-objective adaptive cruise control application for autonomous vehicles. Benchmark comparisons with state-of-the-art constraint-handling techniques demonstrate faster convergence and improved computational efficiency.

| **[Robust Filtering -- Novel Statistical Learning and Inference Algorithms with Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11530v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However, real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |
| **[LEMON-Mapping: Loop-Enhanced Large-Scale Multi-Session Point Cloud Merging and Optimization for Globally Consistent Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10018v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot collaboration is becoming increasingly critical and presents significant challenges in modern robotics, especially for building a globally consistent, accurate map. Traditional multi-robot pose graph optimization (PGO) methods ensure basic global consistency but ignore the geometric structure of the map, and only use loop closures as constraints between pose nodes, leading to divergence and blurring in overlapping regions. To address this issue, we propose LEMON-Mapping, a loop-enhanced framework for large-scale, multi-session point cloud fusion and optimization. We re-examine the role of loops for multi-robot mapping and introduce three key innovations. First, we develop a robust loop processing mechanism that rejects outliers and a loop recall strategy to recover mistakenly removed but valid loops. Second, we introduce spatial bundle adjustment for multi-robot maps, reducing divergence and eliminating blurring in overlaps. Third, we design a PGO-based approach that leverages refined bundle adjustment constraints to propagate local accuracy to the entire map. We validate LEMON-Mapping on several public datasets and a self-collected dataset. The experimental results show superior mapping accuracy and global consistency of our framework compared to traditional merging methods. Scalability experiments also demonstrate its strong capability to handle scenarios involving numerous robots.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a method to realize state estimation of dump truck position, orientation and articulation angle using multiple GNSS for automatic operation of dump trucks. RTK-GNSS is commonly used for automation of construction equipment, but in mountainous areas, mobile networks often unstable, and RTK-GNSS using GNSS reference stations cannot be used. Therefore, this paper develops a state estimation method for dump trucks that does not require a GNSS reference station by using the Centimeter Level Augmentation Service (CLAS) of the Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS). Although CLAS is capable of centimeter-level position estimation, its positioning accuracy and ambiguity fix rate are lower than those of RTK-GNSS. To solve this problem, we construct a state estimation method by factor graph optimization that combines CLAS positioning and moving-base RTK-GNSS between multiple GNSS antennas. Evaluation tests under real-world environments have shown that the proposed method can estimate the state of dump trucks with the same accuracy as conventional RTK-GNSS, but does not require a GNSS reference station.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ION 2024 Pacific PNT Meeting</p></details> |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, it has not been adequately considered and studied for LiDAR-based odometry. In this paper, we propose a novel tightly-coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry based on the MSCKF framework, named MSC-LIO. An efficient LiDAR same-plane cluster (LSPC) tracking method, without explicit feature extraction, is present for frame-to-frame data associations. The tracked LSPC is used to build an LSPC measurement model that constructs multi-state constraints. Besides, we propose an effective point-velocity-based LiDAR-IMU time-delay (LITD) estimation method, which is derived from the proposed LSPC tracking method. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments on both public datasets and real-world environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed MSC-LIO yields higher accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments indicate that the data-association efficiency is improved by nearly 3 times with the LSPC tracking, and the proposed LITD estimation method can effectively and accurately estimate the LITD. Besides, MSC-LIO was implemented on an edge device and demonstrated excellent real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Starting from a few keyframes representing distinct animal poses -- generated via text-to-image prompting or GPT-4o -- we formulate dance synthesis as a graph optimization problem: find the optimal keyframe structure that satisfies a specified choreography pattern of beats, which can be automatically estimated from a reference dance video. We also introduce an approach for mirrored pose image generation, essential for capturing symmetry in dance. In-between frames are synthesized using an video diffusion model.

Unlike prior work in embedding inversion attacks that treat languages independently, LAGO explicitly models linguistic relationships through a graph-based constrained distributed optimization framework. By integrating syntactic and lexical similarity as edge constraints, our method enables collaborative parameter learning across related languages. Theoretically, we show this formulation generalizes prior approaches, such as ALGEN, which emerges as a special case when similarity constraints are relaxed. Our framework uniquely combines Frobenius-norm regularization with linear inequality or total variation constraints, ensuring robust alignment of cross-lingual embedding spaces even with extremely limited data (as few as 10 samples per language). Extensive experiments across multiple languages and embedding models demonstrate that LAGO substantially improves the transferability of attacks with 10-20% increase in Rouge-L score over baselines. This work establishes language similarity as a critical factor in inversion attack transferability, urging renewed focus on language-aware privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reduction-based Algorithm for the Clique Interdiction Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12022v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Clique Interdiction Problem (CIP) aims to minimize the size of the largest clique in a given graph by removing a given number of vertices. The CIP models a special Stackelberg game and has important applications in fields such as pandemic control and terrorist identification. However, the CIP is a bilevel graph optimization problem, making it very challenging to solve. Recently, data reduction techniques have been successfully applied in many (single-level) graph optimization problems like the vertex cover problem. Motivated by this, we investigate a set of novel reduction rules and design a reduction-based algorithm, RECIP, for practically solving the CIP. RECIP enjoys an effective preprocessing procedure that systematically reduces the input graph, making the problem much easier to solve. Extensive experiments on 124 large real-world networks demonstrate the superior performance of RECIP and validate the effectiveness of the proposed reduction rules.</p></details> |  |

In the communication-constrained multi-agent setting, navigation systems increasingly use point-to-point range sensors as they afford measurements with low bandwidth requirements and known data association. The state estimation problem for these systems takes the form of range-aided (RA) SLAM. However, distributed algorithms for solving the RA-SLAM problem lack formal guarantees on the quality of the returned estimate. To this end, we present the first distributed algorithm for RA-SLAM that can efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions. Our algorithm, distributed certifiably correct RA-SLAM (DCORA), achieves this via the Riemannian Staircase method, where computational procedures developed for distributed certifiably correct pose graph optimization are generalized to the RA-SLAM problem. We demonstrate DCORA's efficacy on real-world multi-agent datasets by achieving absolute trajectory errors comparable to those of a state-of-the-art centralized certifiably correct RA-SLAM algorithm. Additionally, we perform a parametric study on the structure of the RA-SLAM problem using synthetic data, revealing how common parameters affect DCORA's performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, accepted to the 2025 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

| **[Constrained Factor Graph Optimization for Robust Networked Pedestrian Inertial Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08229v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel constrained Factor Graph Optimization (FGO)-based approach for networked inertial navigation in pedestrian localization. To effectively mitigate the drift inherent in inertial navigation solutions, we incorporate kinematic constraints directly into the nonlinear optimization framework. Specifically, we utilize equality constraints, such as Zero-Velocity Updates (ZUPTs), and inequality constraints representing the maximum allowable distance between body-mounted Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) based on human anatomical limitations. While equality constraints are straightforwardly integrated as error factors, inequality constraints cannot be explicitly represented in standard FGO formulations. To address this, we introduce a differentiable softmax-based penalty term in the FGO cost function to enforce inequality constraints smoothly and robustly. The proposed constrained FGO approach leverages temporal correlations across multiple epochs, resulting in optimal state trajectory estimates while consistently maintaining constraint satisfaction. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms conventional Kalman filter approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for pedestrian navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Integrated Localization and Path Planning for an Ocean Exploring Team of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with Consensus Graph Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07484v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) coordinated by an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is efficient and reliable for deep ocean exploration. AUVs depart from and return to the USV after collaborative navigation, data collection, and ocean exploration missions. Efficient path planning and accurate localization are essential, the latter of which is critical due to the lack of global localization signals and poor radio frequency (RF) communication in deep waters. Inertial navigation and acoustic communication are common solutions for localization. However, the former is subject to odometry drifts, and the latter is limited to short distances. This paper proposes a systematic approach for localization-aware energy-efficient collision-free path planning for a USV-AUVs team. Path planning is formulated as finite receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) optimization. A dynamic-aware linear kinodynamic motion equation is developed. The mathematical formulation for the MPC optimization is effectively developed where localization is integrated as consensus graph optimization among AUV nodes. Edges in the optimized AUV-to-USV (A2U) and AUV-to-AUV (A2A) graphs are constrained to the sonar range of acoustic modems. The time complexity of the consensus MPC optimization problem is analyzed, revealing a nonconvex NP-hard problem, which is solved using sequential convex programming. Numerical simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Message Optimality and Message-Time Trade-offs for APSP and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21781v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Round complexity is an extensively studied metric of distributed algorithms. In contrast, our knowledge of the \emph{message complexity} of distributed computing problems and its relationship (if any) with round complexity is still quite limited. To illustrate, for many fundamental distributed graph optimization problems such as (exact) diameter computation, All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), Maximum Matching etc., while (near) round-optimal algorithms are known, message-optimal algorithms are hitherto unknown. More importantly, the existing round-optimal algorithms are not message-optimal. This raises two important questions: (1) Can we design message-optimal algorithms for these problems? (2) Can we give message-time tradeoffs for these problems in case the message-optimal algorithms are not round-optimal? In this work, we focus on a fundamental graph optimization problem, \emph{All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)}, whose message complexity is still unresolved. We present two main results in the CONGEST model: (1) We give a message-optimal (up to logarithmic factors) algorithm that solves weighted APSP, using $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ messages. This algorithm takes $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ rounds. (2) For any $0 \leq \varepsilon \le 1$, we show how to solve unweighted APSP in $\tilde{O}(n^{2-\varepsilon })$ rounds and $\tilde{O}(n^{2+\varepsilon })$ messages. At one end of this smooth trade-off, we obtain a (nearly) message-optimal algorithm using $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ messages (for $\varepsilon = 0$), whereas at the other end we get a (nearly) round-optimal algorithm using $\tilde{O}(n)$ rounds (for $\varepsilon = 1$). This is the first such message-time trade-off result known.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PODC 2025, abstract shortened to fit arXiv constraints</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods. For widespread use and further development, the research work is fully open-source at https://github.com/Anastasiawd/BrightVO.</p></details> |  |

This framework enables high-precision and highly robust real-time state estimation and map construction in challenging environments, such as LiDAR-degraded, low-texture regions, and feature-scarce areas. The LPVIMO-SAM comprises two subsystems: a Polarized Vision-Inertial System and a LiDAR/Inertial/Magnetometer/Optical Flow System. The polarized vision enhances the robustness of the Visual/Inertial odometry in low-feature and low-texture scenarios by extracting the polarization information of the scene. The magnetometer acquires the heading angle, and the optical flow obtains the speed and height to reduce the accumulated error. A magnetometer heading prior factor, an optical flow speed observation factor, and a height observation factor are designed to eliminate the cumulative errors of the LiDAR/Inertial odometry through factor graph optimization. Meanwhile, the LPVIMO-SAM can maintain stable positioning even when one of the two subsystems fails, further expanding its applicability in LiDAR-degraded, low-texture, and low-feature environments.

For wheeled robots, a wheel kinematic model (i.e., wheel odometry) can improve the reliability of the odometry estimation. However, the kinematic model suffers from complex motions (e.g., wheel slippage, lateral movement) in the case of skid-steering robots particularly because this robot model rotates by skidding its wheels. Furthermore, these errors change nonlinearly when the wheel slippage is large (e.g., drifting) and are subject to terrain-dependent parameters. To simultaneously tackle point cloud degeneration and the kinematic model errors, we developed a LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry algorithm incorporating online training of a neural network that learns the kinematic model of wheeled robots with nonlinearity. We propose to train the neural network online on a factor graph along with robot states, allowing the learning-based kinematic model to adapt to the current terrain condition. The proposed method jointly solves online training of the neural network and LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of all those constraints. Through experiments, we first verified that the proposed network adapted to a changing environment, resulting in an accurate odometry estimation across different environments. We then confirmed that the proposed odometry estimation algorithm was robust against point cloud degeneration and nonlinearity (e.g., large wheel slippage by drifting) of the kinematic model.

| **[Disentangled Graph Representation Based on Substructure-Aware Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16360v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs effectively characterize relational data, driving graph representation learning methods that uncover underlying predictive information. As state-of-the-art approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable end-to-end learning for diverse tasks. Recent disentangled graph representation learning enhances interpretability by decoupling independent factors in graph data. However, existing methods often implicitly and coarsely characterize graph structures, limiting structural pattern analysis within the graph. This paper proposes the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Network (GOMKCN) to address this limitation. We view graphs as node-centric subgraphs, where each subgraph acts as a structural factor encoding position-specific information. This transforms graph prediction into structural pattern recognition. Inspired by CNNs, GOMKCN introduces the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel (GOMK) as a convolutional operator, computing similarities between subgraphs and learnable graph filters. Mathematically, GOMK maps subgraphs and filters into a Hilbert space, representing graphs as point sets. Disentangled representations emerge from projecting subgraphs onto task-optimized filters, which adaptively capture relevant structural patterns via gradient descent. Crucially, GOMK incorporates local correspondences in similarity measurement, resolving the trade-off between differentiability and accuracy in graph kernels. Experiments validate that GOMKCN achieves superior accuracy and interpretability in graph pattern mining and prediction. The framework advances the theoretical foundation for disentangled graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we build upon our prior work on cooperative localization between an aerial drone and ground robot that fuses data from LiDAR, inertial navigation, peer-to-peer ranging, altimeter, and stereo-vision and evaluate the incorporation knowledge from the autopilot regarding when the drone is hovering. This control command data is leveraged to add constraints on the velocity state. Hover constraints can be considered important dynamic model information, such as the exploitation of zero-velocity updates in pedestrian navigation. We analyze the benefits of these constraints using an incremental factor graph optimization. Experimental data collected in a motion capture faculty is used to provide performance insights and assess the benefits of hover constraints.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications.

However, dense point clouds face challenges of high memory consumption and reduced maintainability for long-term operations. In this study, we introduce SLIM, a scalable and lightweight mapping system for long-term LiDAR mapping in urban environments. The system begins by parameterizing structural point clouds into lines and planes. These lightweight and structural representations meet the requirements of map merging, pose graph optimization, and bundle adjustment, ensuring incremental management and local consistency. For long-term operations, a map-centric nonlinear factor recovery method is designed to sparsify poses while preserving mapping accuracy. We validate the SLIM system with multi-session real-world LiDAR data from classical LiDAR mapping datasets, including KITTI, NCLT, HeLiPR and M2DGR. The experiments demonstrate its capabilities in mapping accuracy, lightweightness, and scalability. Map re-use is also verified through map-based robot localization. Finally, with multi-session LiDAR data, the SLIM system provides a globally consistent map with low memory consumption (~130 KB/km on KITTI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow sensing Field-of-View (FoV), resulting in degenerated accuracy and limited robustness in textureless environments. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy with much wider FoV. However, the usual arbitrary placement and orientation of multiple cameras make the pose scale estimation and system updating challenging. To address these problems, we propose a robust visual odometry system for rigidly-bundled arbitrarily-arranged multi-cameras, namely MCVO, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams to GPU. Then we initialize the odometry system with the metric-scale poses under the rigid constraints between moving cameras. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate its robustness over arbitrarily arranged cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose accuracy with better generalization ability.

We argue that latent codes stored in many NeRF SLAM systems are not fully exploited, as they are only used for better reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to detect potential loops using the same latent codes as local features. To further improve the loop detection performance, we use the semantic information, which are also decoded from the same latent codes to guide the aggregation of local features. Finally, with the potential loops detected, we close them with a graph optimization followed by bundle adjustment to refine both the estimated poses and the reconstructed scene. To evaluate the performance of our SLC$^2$-SLAM, we conduct extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet datasets. Our proposed semantic-guided loop closure significantly outperforms the pre-trained NetVLAD and ORB combined with Bag-of-Words, which are used in all the other NeRF SLAM with loop closure. As a result, our SLC$^2$-SLAM also demonstrated better tracking and reconstruction performance, especially in larger scenes with more loops, like ScanNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RAL. 8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To overcome the shortcomings of standalone UWB systems in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios and the inherent drift associated with inertial navigation, we developed a novel hybrid fusion framework. First, a dynamic covariance estimation mechanism is incorporated, which automatically adjusts measurement weights based on real-time channel conditions. Then, a tightly-coupled sensor fusion architecture is employed, utilizing IMU pre-integration theory for temporal synchronization. Finally, a sliding-window factor graph optimization backend is utilized, incorporating NLOS mitigation constraints. Experimental results in complex indoor environments show a 38\% improvement in positioning accuracy compared to conventional Kalman filter-based approaches, achieving a 12.3 cm root mean square (RMS) error under dynamic motion conditions. The system maintains robust performance even with intermittent UWB signal availability, down to a 40\% packet reception rate, effectively suppressing IMU drift through multi-modal constraint fusion. This work offers a practical solution for applications that require reliable indoor positioning in GPS-denied environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[KISS-SLAM: A Simple, Robust, and Accurate 3D LiDAR SLAM System With Enhanced Generalization Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12660v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate localization and mapping of an environment using laser scanners, so-called LiDAR SLAM, is essential to many robotic applications. Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, tightly-coupled Acoustic-Visual-Inertial SLAM approach, termed AQUA-SLAM, to fuse a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), a stereo camera, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) within a graph optimization framework. Moreover, we propose an efficient sensor calibration technique, encompassing multi-sensor extrinsic calibration (among the DVL, camera and IMU) and DVL transducer misalignment calibration, with a fast linear approximation procedure for real-time online execution. The proposed methods are extensively evaluated in a tank environment with ground truth, and validated for offshore applications in the North Sea. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art underwater and visual-inertial SLAM systems in terms of localization accuracy and robustness. The proposed system will be made open-source for the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speedy MASt3R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10017v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image matching is a key component of modern 3D vision algorithms, essential for accurate scene reconstruction and localization. MASt3R redefines image matching as a 3D task by leveraging DUSt3R and introducing a fast reciprocal matching scheme that accelerates matching by orders of magnitude while preserving theoretical guarantees. This approach has gained strong traction, with DUSt3R and MASt3R collectively cited over 250 times in a short span, underscoring their impact. However, despite its accuracy, MASt3R's inference speed remains a bottleneck. On an A40 GPU, latency per image pair is 198.16 ms, mainly due to computational overhead from the ViT encoder-decoder and Fast Reciprocal Nearest Neighbor (FastNN) matching. To address this, we introduce Speedy MASt3R, a post-training optimization framework that enhances inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy. It integrates multiple optimization techniques, including FlashMatch-an approach leveraging FlashAttention v2 with tiling strategies for improved efficiency, computation graph optimization via layer and tensor fusion having kernel auto-tuning with TensorRT (GraphFusion), and a streamlined FastNN pipeline that reduces memory access time from quadratic to linear while accelerating block-wise correlation scoring through vectorized computation (FastNN-Lite). Additionally, it employs mixed-precision inference with FP16/FP32 hybrid computations (HybridCast), achieving speedup while preserving numerical precision. Evaluated on Aachen Day-Night, InLoc, 7-Scenes, ScanNet1500, and MegaDepth1500, Speedy MASt3R achieves a 54% reduction in inference time (198 ms to 91 ms per image pair) without sacrificing accuracy. This advancement enables real-time 3D understanding, benefiting applications like mixed reality navigation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.

However, existing SLAM methods typically merely remove the dynamic parts or require RGB-D input, while offline methods are not scalable to long video sequences, and current transformer-based feedforward methods lack global consistency and appearance details. To this end, we achieve online dynamic scene reconstruction by disentangling the static and dynamic parts within a SLAM system. The poses are tracked robustly with a novel motion masking strategy, and dynamic parts are reconstructed leveraging a progressive adaptation of a Motion Scaffolds graph. Our method yields novel view renderings competitive to offline methods and achieves on-par tracking with state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present the first application of incremental optimisation techniques to Dynamic SLAM. We introduce a novel factor-graph formulation and system architecture designed to take advantage of existing incremental optimisation methods and support online estimation. On multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves equal to or better than state-of-the-art in camera pose and object motion accuracy. We further analyse the structural properties of our approach to demonstrate its scalability and provide insight regarding the challenges of solving Dynamic SLAM incrementally. Finally, we show that our formulation results in problem structure well-suited to incremental solvers, while our system architecture further enhances performance, achieving a 5x speed-up over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, Submitted RA-L 2025</p></details> |

Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment assumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic SLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic features, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point features for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by continuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point features, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current methods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity, causing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential performance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism that evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line feature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system to introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing computational complexity of additional features while minimizing the introduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the introduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses through tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global optimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional features in long-term process. Extensive experiments on TUM datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in both ATE and RPE metrics compared to ORB-SLAM3 baseline and superior performance over other dynamic SLAM and multi-feature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to International Conference on Robotic Computing and Communication(IEEE IRC)</p></details> |

In feature-based SLAM, the quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2) insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies. To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii) depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient. Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods, achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[NGD-SLAM: Towards Real-Time Dynamic SLAM without GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07392v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing visual SLAM methods can achieve high localization accuracy in dynamic environments by leveraging deep learning to mask moving objects. However, these methods incur significant computational overhead as the camera tracking needs to wait for the deep neural network to generate mask at each frame, and they typically require GPUs for real-time operation, which restricts their practicality in real-world robotic applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time dynamic SLAM system that runs exclusively on a CPU. Our approach incorporates a mask propagation mechanism that decouples camera tracking and deep learning-based masking for each frame. We also introduce a hybrid tracking strategy that integrates ORB features with optical flow methods, enhancing both robustness and efficiency by selectively allocating computational resources to input frames. Compared to previous methods, our system maintains high localization accuracy in dynamic environments while achieving a tracking frame rate of 60 FPS on a laptop CPU. These results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing deep learning for dynamic SLAM without GPU support. Since most existing dynamic SLAM systems are not open-source, we make our code publicly available at: https://github.com/yuhaozhang7/NGD-SLAM</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

However, in certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks cannot fully cover dynamic regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects. Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2 maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods.

However, in real-world environments with dynamic objects, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems often face mapping errors and tracking drift issues. To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Although effective for accurate visual odometry in complex scenarios, these methods discard crucial information about moving objects. By incorporating this information into a Dynamic SLAM framework, the motion of dynamic entities can be estimated, enhancing navigation whilst ensuring accurate localization. However, the fundamental formulation of Dynamic SLAM remains an open challenge, with no consensus on the optimal approach for accurate motion estimation within a SLAM pipeline. Therefore, we developed DynoSAM, an open-source framework for Dynamic SLAM that enables the efficient implementation, testing, and comparison of various Dynamic SLAM optimization formulations. DynoSAM integrates static and dynamic measurements into a unified optimization problem solved using factor graphs, simultaneously estimating camera poses, static scene, object motion or poses, and object structures. We evaluate DynoSAM across diverse simulated and real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art motion estimation in indoor and outdoor environments, with substantial improvements over existing systems. Additionally, we demonstrate DynoSAM utility in downstream applications, including 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes and trajectory prediction, thereby showcasing potential for advancing dynamic object-aware SLAM systems.

This paper proposes a time-varying representation to track and reconstruct the dynamic scenes. Firstly, two processes, a tracking process and a mapping process, are maintained simultaneously in our framework. In the tracking process, all input images are uniformly sampled and then progressively trained in a self-supervised paradigm. In the mapping process, we leverage motion masks to distinguish dynamic objects from the static background, and sample more pixels from dynamic areas. Secondly, the parameter optimization for both processes is comprised of two stages: the first stage associates time with 3D positions to convert the deformation field to the canonical field. The second stage associates time with the embeddings of the canonical field to obtain colors and a Signed Distance Function (SDF). Lastly, we propose a novel keyframe selection strategy based on the overlapping rate. Our approach is evaluated on two synthetic datasets and one real-world dataset, and the experiments validate that our method achieves competitive results in both tracking and mapping when compared to existing state-of-the-art NeRF-based dynamic SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in dense SLAM have leveraged Gaussian Splatting to enhance scene representation, most approaches assume a static environment, making them vulnerable to photometric and geometric inconsistencies caused by dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we integrate Gaussian Splatting SLAM with a robust filtering process to handle dynamic objects throughout the entire pipeline, including Gaussian insertion and keyframe selection. Within this framework, to further improve the accuracy of dynamic object removal, we introduce a robust mask generation method that enforces photometric consistency across keyframes, reducing noise from inaccurate segmentation and artifacts such as shadows. Additionally, we propose the loop-aware window selection mechanism, which utilizes unique keyframe IDs of 3D Gaussians to detect loops between the current and past frames, facilitating joint optimization of the current camera poses and the Gaussian map. DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both camera tracking and novel view synthesis on various dynamic SLAM benchmarks, proving its effectiveness in handling real-world dynamic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

However, their performance significantly deteriorates when deployed in settings with a higher presence of movable objects, such as environments with pedestrians, cars, and buses, which are common in outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based real-time stereo SLAM system that leverages complete geometry information to avoid information loss. Moreover, there is currently no publicly available dataset for directly evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic and static feature classification methods, and to bridge this gap, we have created a publicly available dataset containing over 50,000 feature points. Experimental results demonstrate that our MLP-based dynamic and static feature point discriminator has achieved superior performance compared to other methods on this dataset. Furthermore, the MLP-based real-time stereo SLAM system has shown the highest average precision and fastest speed on the outdoor KITTI tracking datasets compared to other dynamic SLAM systems.The open-source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/TaozheLi/MLP-SLAM.</p></details> | Dynamic SLAM |

To enable robots to safely navigate and plan in dynamic environments, it is essential to employ representations capable of handling moving objects. Dynamic SLAM is an emerging field in SLAM research as it improves the overall system accuracy while providing additional estimation of object motions. State-of-the-art literature informs two main formulations for Dynamic SLAM, representing dynamic object points in either the world or object coordinate frame. While expressing object points in a local reference frame may seem intuitive, it may not necessarily lead to the most accurate and robust solutions. This paper conducts and presents a thorough analysis of various Dynamic SLAM formulations, identifying the best approach to address the problem.

However, deploying such a system within a dynamic environment has not been well-studied. Such challenges are intractable even for conventional algorithms since observations from different views with dynamic objects involved break the geometric and photometric consistency, whereas the consistency lays the foundation for joint optimizing the camera pose and the map parameters. In this paper, we best exploit the characteristics of continual learning and propose a novel SLAM framework for dynamic environments. While past efforts have been made to avoid catastrophic forgetting by exploiting an experience replay strategy, we view forgetting as a desirable characteristic. By adaptively controlling the replayed buffer, the ambiguity caused by moving objects can be easily alleviated through forgetting. We restrain the replay of the dynamic objects by introducing a continually-learned classifier for dynamic object identification. The iterative optimization of the neural map and the classifier notably improves the robustness of the SLAM system under a dynamic environment. Experiments on challenging datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach relies on a static environment assumption and does not work robustly within a dynamic environment due to the inconsistent observation of geometry and photometry. To address the challenges presented in dynamic environments, we propose a novel dynamic SLAM framework with neural radiance field. Specifically, we introduce a motion mask generation method to filter out the invalid sampled rays. This design effectively fuses the optical flow mask and semantic mask to enhance the precision of motion mask. To further improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we have designed a divide-and-conquer pose optimization algorithm that distinguishes between keyframes and non-keyframes. The proposed edge warp loss can effectively enhance the geometry constraints between adjacent frames. Extensive experiments are conducted on the two challenging datasets, and the results show that RoDyn-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance among recent neural RGB-D methods in both accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | IEEE RAL 2024 |

While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

This paper develops a real-time multi-object tracking and prediction system in rugged environments. A 3D object detection algorithm based on Lidar-camera fusion is designed to detect the target objects. Based on the Hungarian algorithm, this paper designs a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm with an adaptive threshold to realize the stable matching and tracking of the objects. We combine Memory Augmented Neural Networks (MANN) and Kalman filter to achieve 3D trajectory prediction on rugged terrains. Besides, we realize a new dynamic SLAM by using the results of multi-object tracking to remove dynamic points for better SLAM performance and static map. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-object tracking and prediction system, several simulations and physical experiments are conducted. The results show that the proposed system can track dynamic objects and provide future trajectory and a more clean static map in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 8 figures, submitted to ROBIO2023</p></details> |
| **[Simulation of Dynamic Environments for SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04286v2)** | 2023-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation engines are widely adopted in robotics. However, they lack either full simulation control, ROS integration, realistic physics, or photorealism. Recently, synthetic data generation and realistic rendering has advanced tasks like target tracking and human pose estimation. However, when focusing on vision applications, there is usually a lack of information like sensor measurements or time continuity. On the other hand, simulations for most robotics tasks are performed in (semi)static environments, with specific sensors and low visual fidelity. To solve this, we introduced in our previous work a fully customizable framework for generating realistic animated dynamic environments (GRADE) [1]. We use GRADE to generate an indoor dynamic environment dataset and then compare multiple SLAM algorithms on different sequences. By doing that, we show how current research over-relies on known benchmarks, failing to generalize. Our tests with refined YOLO and Mask R-CNN models provide further evidence that additional research in dynamic SLAM is necessary.

| **[RGB-D-Inertial SLAM in Indoor Dynamic Environments with Long-term Large Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13316v1)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel RGB-D-inertial dynamic SLAM method that can enable accurate localisation when the majority of the camera view is occluded by multiple dynamic objects over a long period of time. Most dynamic SLAM approaches either remove dynamic objects as outliers when they account for a minor proportion of the visual input, or detect dynamic objects using semantic segmentation before camera tracking. Therefore, dynamic objects that cause large occlusions are difficult to detect without prior information. The remaining visual information from the static background is also not enough to support localisation when large occlusion lasts for a long period. To overcome these problems, our framework presents a robust visual-inertial bundle adjustment that simultaneously tracks camera, estimates cluster-wise dense segmentation of dynamic objects and maintains a static sparse map by combining dense and sparse features. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves promising localisation and object segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods in the scenario of long-term large occlusion.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TwistSLAM++: Fusing multiple modalities for accurate dynamic semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07888v2)** | 2023-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most classical SLAM systems rely on the static scene assumption, which limits their applicability in real world scenarios. Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLAM Backends with Objects in Motion: A Unifying Framework and Tutorial](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05043v7)** | 2023-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms are frequently deployed to support a wide range of robotics applications, such as autonomous navigation in unknown environments, and scene mapping in virtual reality. Many of these applications require autonomous agents to perform SLAM in highly dynamic scenes. To this end, this tutorial extends a recently introduced, unifying optimization-based SLAM backend framework to environments with moving objects and features. Using this framework, we consider a rapprochement of recent advances in dynamic SLAM. Moreover, we present dynamic EKF SLAM: a novel, filtering-based dynamic SLAM algorithm generated from our framework, and prove that it is mathematically equivalent to a direct extension of the classical EKF SLAM algorithm to the dynamic environment setting. Empirical results with simulated data indicate that dynamic EKF SLAM can achieve high localization and mobile object pose estimation accuracy, as well as high map precision, with high efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amos-SLAM: An Anti-Dynamics Two-stage SLAM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11747v1)** | 2023-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) systems rely on the assumption of a static environment and fail to accurately estimate the system's location when dynamic objects are present in the background. While learning-based dynamic SLAM systems have difficulties in handling unknown moving objects, geometry-based methods have limited success in addressing the residual effects of unidentified dynamic objects on location estimation. To address these issues, we propose an anti-dynamics two-stage SLAM approach. Firstly, the potential motion regions of both prior and non-prior dynamic objects are extracted and pose estimates for dynamic discrimination are quickly obtained using optical flow tracking and model generation methods. Secondly, dynamic points in each frame are removed through dynamic judgment. For non-prior dynamic objects, we present a approach that uses super-pixel extraction and geometric clustering to determine the potential motion regions based on color and geometric information in the image. Evaluations on multiple low and high dynamic sequences in a public RGB-D dataset show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RGB-D SLAM in Indoor Planar Environments with Multiple Large Dynamic Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02882v2)** | 2022-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel dense RGB-D SLAM approach for dynamic planar environments that enables simultaneous multi-object tracking, camera localisation and background reconstruction. Previous dynamic SLAM methods either rely on semantic segmentation to directly detect dynamic objects; or assume that dynamic objects occupy a smaller proportion of the camera view than the static background and can, therefore, be removed as outliers. Our approach, however, enables dense SLAM when the camera view is largely occluded by multiple dynamic objects with the aid of camera motion prior. The dynamic planar objects are separated by their different rigid motions and tracked independently. The remaining dynamic non-planar areas are removed as outliers and not mapped into the background. The evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of localisation, mapping, dynamic segmentation and object tracking. We also demonstrate its robustness to large drift in the camera motion prior.</p></details> | 8 papges, 9 figures |

Dynamic 3D object tracking has then become a significant capability in visual SLAM with the requirement of understanding dynamic surroundings in various scenarios including autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. However, performing dynamic SLAM solely with monocular images remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of associating dynamic features and estimating their positions. In this paper, we present MOTSLAM, a dynamic visual SLAM system with the monocular configuration that tracks both poses and bounding boxes of dynamic objects. MOTSLAM first performs multiple object tracking (MOT) with associated both 2D and 3D bounding box detection to create initial 3D objects. Then, neural-network-based monocular depth estimation is applied to fetch the depth of dynamic features. Finally, camera poses, object poses, and both static, as well as dynamic map points, are jointly optimized using a novel bundle adjustment. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our system has reached best performance on both camera ego-motion and object tracking on monocular dynamic SLAM.</p></details> |  |

Several SLAM systems with impressive performance have been invented and used during the last several decades. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as how to deal with moving objects in dynamic situations. Classic SLAM systems depend on the assumption of a static environment, which becomes unworkable in highly dynamic situations. Several methods have been presented to tackle this issue in recent years, but each has its limitations. This research combines the visual SLAM systems ORB-SLAM3 and Detectron2 to present the Det-SLAM system, which employs depth information and semantic segmentation to identify and eradicate dynamic spots to accomplish semantic SLAM for dynamic situations. Evaluation of public TUM datasets indicates that Det-SLAM is more resilient than previous dynamic SLAM systems and can lower the estimated error of camera posture in dynamic indoor scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Existing methods mainly focus on identifying and excluding dynamic objects from the optimization. In this paper, we show that feature-based visual SLAM systems can also benefit from the presence of dynamic articulated objects by taking advantage of two observations: (1) The 3D structure of each rigid part of articulated object remains consistent over time; (2) The points on the same rigid part follow the same motion. In particular, we present AirDOS, a dynamic object-aware system that introduces rigidity and motion constraints to model articulated objects. By jointly optimizing the camera pose, object motion, and the object 3D structure, we can rectify the camera pose estimation, preventing tracking loss, and generate 4D spatio-temporal maps for both dynamic objects and static scenes. Experiments show that our algorithm improves the robustness of visual SLAM algorithms in challenging crowded urban environments. To the best of our knowledge, AirDOS is the first dynamic object-aware SLAM system demonstrating that camera pose estimation can be improved by incorporating dynamic articulated objects.</p></details> |  |

Even in extremely dynamic scenes, it can robustly optimise for the camera pose, velocity, IMU biases and build a dense 3D reconstruction object-level map of the environment. Our system can robustly track and reconstruct the geometries of arbitrary objects, their semantics and motion by incrementally fusing associated colour, depth, semantic, and foreground object probabilities into each object model thanks to its robust sensor and object tracking. In addition, when an object is lost or moved outside the camera field of view, our system can reliably recover its pose upon re-observation. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our method by quantitatively and qualitatively testing it in real-world data sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2022</p></details> |

However, most of the current lidar SLAM approaches are based on the assumption of a static environment. Hence the localization in a dynamic environment with multiple moving objects is actually unreliable. The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively. RF-LIO is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Currently, several approaches achieve the avoidance of static obstacles based on the mapping of indoor scenes. To solve the issue of distinguishing dynamic obstacles, we propose an assistive system with an RGB-D sensor to detect dynamic information of a scene. Once the system captures an image, panoptic segmentation is performed to obtain the prior dynamic object information. With sparse feature points extracted from images and the depth information, poses of the user can be estimated. After the ego-motion estimation, the dynamic object can be identified and tracked. Then, poses and speed of tracked dynamic objects can be estimated, which are passed to the users through acoustic feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCHP 2022</p></details> |

Recently, some related works generally use the combination of semantic constraints and geometric constraints to deal with dynamic objects, but problems can still be raised, such as poor real-time performance, easy to treat people as rigid bodies, and poor performance in low dynamic scenes. In this paper, a dynamic scene-oriented visual SLAM algorithm based on object detection and coarse-to-fine static probability named CFP-SLAM is proposed. The algorithm combines semantic constraints and geometric constraints to calculate the static probability of objects, keypoints and map points, and takes them as weights to participate in camera pose estimation. Extensive evaluations show that our approach can achieve almost the best results in high dynamic and low dynamic scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods, and shows quite high real-time ability.</p></details> |  |

The motion of rigid objects can be typically tracked by exploiting their texture and geometric features. However, humans moving in the scene are often one of the most important, interactive targets - they are very hard to track and reconstruct robustly due to non-rigid shapes. In this work, we present a fast, learning-based human object detector to isolate the dynamic human objects and realise a real-time dense background reconstruction framework. We go further by estimating and reconstructing the human pose and shape. The final output environment maps not only provide the dense static backgrounds but also contain the dynamic human meshes and their trajectories. Our Dynamic SLAM system runs at around 26 frames per second (fps) on GPUs, while additionally turning on accurate human pose estimation can be executed at up to 10 fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS-2021</p></details> |

Most prior efforts, however, often assume that the target object's CAD model, at least at a category-level, is available for offline training or during online template matching. This work proposes BundleTrack, a general framework for 6D pose tracking of novel objects, which does not depend upon 3D models, either at the instance or category-level. It leverages the complementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation and robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph optimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift tracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions and object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art, category-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against state-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable performance is achieved, despite the proposed method's reduced information requirements. An efficient implementation in CUDA provides a real-time performance of 10Hz for the entire framework. Code is available at: https://github.com/wenbowen123/BundleTrack</p></details> |  |

The proposed framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. The framework supports real-time, decentralized operation onboard the robots and has been integrated with three types of aerial and ground platforms. We validate its effectiveness through experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as benchmarks on public datasets and comparisons with existing methods. The framework is open-sourced and suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot real-time metric-semantic SLAM applications.

Since the first foundational work in Semantic SLAM appeared more than two decades ago, this field has received increasing attention across various scientific communities. Despite its significance, the field lacks comprehensive surveys encompassing recent advances and persistent challenges. In response, this study provides a thorough examination of the state-of-the-art of Semantic SLAM techniques, with the aim of illuminating current trends and key obstacles. Beginning with an in-depth exploration of the evolution of visual SLAM, this study outlines its strengths and unique characteristics, while also critically assessing previous survey literature. Subsequently, a unified problem formulation and evaluation of the modular solution framework is proposed, which divides the problem into discrete stages, including visual localization, semantic feature extraction, mapping, data association, and loop closure optimization. Moreover, this study investigates alternative methodologies such as deep learning and the utilization of large language models, alongside a review of relevant research about contemporary SLAM datasets. Concluding with a discussion on potential future research directions, this study serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers seeking to navigate the complex landscape of Semantic SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Interaction for Collaborative Semantic SLAM using Extended Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14949v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries, as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts (e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy, map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines, demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for future extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[3D Active Metric-Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06950v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter, we address the problem of exploration and metric-semantic mapping of multi-floor GPS-denied indoor environments using Size Weight and Power (SWaP) constrained aerial robots. Most previous work in exploration assumes that robot localization is solved. However, neglecting the state uncertainty of the agent can ultimately lead to cascading errors both in the resulting map and in the state of the agent itself. Furthermore, actions that reduce localization errors may be at direct odds with the exploration task. We propose a framework that balances the efficiency of exploration with actions that reduce the state uncertainty of the agent. In particular, our algorithmic approach for active metric-semantic SLAM is built upon sparse information abstracted from raw problem data, to make it suitable for SWaP-constrained robots. Furthermore, we integrate this framework within a fully autonomous aerial robotic system that achieves autonomous exploration in cluttered, 3D environments. From extensive real-world experiments, we showed that by including Semantic Loop Closure (SLC), we can reduce the robot pose estimation errors by over 90% in translation and approximately 75% in yaw, and the uncertainties in pose estimates and semantic maps by over 70% and 65%, respectively. Although discussed in the context of indoor multi-floor exploration, our system can be used for various other applications, such as infrastructure inspection and precision agriculture where reliable GPS data may not be available.</p></details> |  |

However, creating these maps is challenging because GPS signals are often unreliable under dense tree canopies. Furthermore, standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches struggle in orchards because the repetitive appearance of trees can confuse the system, leading to mapping errors. To address this, we introduce Tree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual trees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with an instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them using a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified trunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS signals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of individual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less than 20\% of the planting distance.

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce an advanced semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both Intra-level and Inter-level optimizations. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, in certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks cannot fully cover dynamic regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects. Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2 maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods.

A Comparative Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12384v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embedded systems, robots must perceive and interpret their environment efficiently to operate reliably in real-world conditions. Visual Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enhances standard SLAM by incorporating semantic information into the map, enabling more informed decision-making. However, implementing such systems on resource-limited hardware involves trade-offs between accuracy, computing efficiency, and power usage. This paper provides a comparative review of recent Semantic Visual SLAM methods with a focus on their applicability to embedded platforms. We analyze three main types of architectures - Geometric SLAM, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and 3D Gaussian Splatting - and evaluate their performance on constrained hardware, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. We compare their accuracy, segmentation quality, memory usage, and energy consumption. Our results show that methods based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting achieve high semantic detail but demand substantial computing resources, limiting their use on embedded devices. In contrast, Semantic Geometric SLAM offers a more practical balance between computational cost and accuracy. The review highlights a need for SLAM algorithms that are better adapted to embedded environments, and it discusses key directions for improving their efficiency through algorithm-hardware co-design.</p></details> |  |

Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications.

However, previous methods are generally constrained by limited-category pre-trained classifiers and implicit semantic representation, which hinder their performance in open-set scenarios and restrict 3D object-level scene understanding. To address these issues, we propose OpenGS-SLAM, an innovative framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian representation to perform dense semantic SLAM in open-set environments. Our system integrates explicit semantic labels derived from 2D foundational models into the 3D Gaussian framework, facilitating robust 3D object-level scene understanding. We introduce Gaussian Voting Splatting to enable fast 2D label map rendering and scene updating. Additionally, we propose a Confidence-based 2D Label Consensus method to ensure consistent labeling across multiple views. Furthermore, we employ a Segmentation Counter Pruning strategy to improve the accuracy of semantic scene representation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in scene understanding, tracking, and mapping, achieving 10 times faster semantic rendering and 2 times lower storage costs compared to existing methods.

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an object-based semantic SLAM method for underwater environments that can identify, localize, classify, and map a wide variety of marine objects without a priori knowledge of the object classes present in the scene. The method performs unsupervised object segmentation and object-level feature aggregation, and then uses opti-acoustic sensor fusion for object localization. Probabilistic data association is used to determine observation to landmark correspondences. Given such correspondences, the method then jointly optimizes landmark and vehicle position estimates. Indoor and outdoor underwater datasets with a wide variety of objects and challenging acoustic and lighting conditions are collected for evaluation and made publicly available. Quantitative and qualitative results show the proposed method achieves reduced trajectory error compared to baseline methods, and is able to obtain comparable map accuracy to a baseline closed-set method that requires hand-labeled data of all objects in the scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor typo tixes and clarifications</p></details> |

A robot's exploration behavior can be inherently affected by the performance of its Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) subsystem, although SLAM and exploration are generally studied separately. In this paper, we formulate exploration as an active mapping problem and extend it with semantic information. We introduce a novel active metric-semantic SLAM approach, leveraging recent research advances in information theory and spectral graph theory: we combine semantic mutual information and the connectivity metrics of the underlying pose graph of the SLAM subsystem. We use the resulting utility function to evaluate different trajectories to select the most favorable strategy during exploration. Exploration and SLAM metrics are analyzed in experiments. Running our algorithm on the Habitat dataset, we show that, while maintaining efficiency close to the state-of-the-art exploration methods, our approach effectively increases the performance of metric-semantic SLAM with a 21% reduction in average map error and a 9% improvement in average semantic classification accuracy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Commonly, 3D semantic reconstruction systems capture the entire scene in the same level of detail. However, certain tasks (e.g., object interaction) require a fine-grained and high-resolution map, particularly if the objects to interact are of small size or intricate geometry. In recent practice, this leads to the entire map being in the same high-quality resolution, which results in increased computational and storage costs. To address this challenge, we propose MAP-ADAPT, a real-time method for quality-adaptive semantic 3D reconstruction using RGBD frames. MAP-ADAPT is the first adaptive semantic 3D mapping algorithm that, unlike prior work, generates directly a single map with regions of different quality based on both the semantic information and the geometric complexity of the scene. Leveraging a semantic SLAM pipeline for pose and semantic estimation, we achieve comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world data, while significantly reducing storage and computation requirements.</p></details> |  |

While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

In this system, we introduce hierarchical semantic representation to allow multi-level semantic comprehension for top-down structured semantic mapping of the scene. In addition, to fully utilize the correlation between multiple attributes of the environment, we integrate appearance, geometry and semantic features through cross-attention for feature collaboration. This strategy enables a more multifaceted understanding of the environment, thereby allowing SNI-SLAM to remain robust even when single attribute is defective. Then, we design an internal fusion-based decoder to obtain semantic, RGB, Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) values from multi-level features for accurate decoding. Furthermore, we propose a feature loss to update the scene representation at the feature level. Compared with low-level losses such as RGB loss and depth loss, our feature loss is capable of guiding the network optimization on a higher-level.

However, dynamic objects contained in point cloud maps not only downgrade localization accuracy and navigation performance but also jeopardize the map quality. In response to this challenge, we propose in this paper a novel semantic SLAM approach for dynamic scenes based on LiDAR point clouds, referred to as SD-SLAM hereafter. The main contributions of this work are in three aspects: 1) introducing a semantic SLAM framework dedicatedly for dynamic scenes based on LiDAR point clouds, 2) Employing semantics and Kalman filtering to effectively differentiate between dynamic and semi-static landmarks, and 3) Making full use of semi-static and pure static landmarks with semantic information in the SD-SLAM process to improve localization and mapping performance. To evaluate the proposed SD-SLAM, tests were conducted using the widely adopted KITTI odometry dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed SD-SLAM effectively mitigates the adverse effects of dynamic objects on SLAM, improving vehicle localization and mapping performance in dynamic scenes, and simultaneously constructing a static semantic map with multiple semantic classes for enhanced environment understanding.</p></details> |  |

In the future, service robots will be expected to perform complex tasks like 'Set table for dinner'. High-level tasks like these, require, among other capabilities, the ability to retrieve multiple targets. This paper delves into the challenge of locating multiple targets in an environment, termed 'Find my Objects.' We present a novel heuristic designed to facilitate robots in conducting a preferential search for multiple targets in indoor spaces. Our approach involves a Semantic SLAM framework that combines semantic object recognition with geometric data to generate a multi-layered map. We fuse the semantic maps with probabilistic priors for efficient inferencing. Recognizing the challenges introduced by obstacles that might obscure a navigation goal and render standard point-to-point navigation strategies less viable, our methodology offers resilience to such factors. Importantly, our method is adaptable to various object detectors, RGB-D SLAM techniques, and local navigation planners. We demonstrate the 'Find my Objects' task in real-world indoor environments, yielding quantitative results that attest to the effectiveness of our methodology.

While achieving impressive performance on small synthetic scenes, these methods often suffer from oversmoothed reconstructions, especially for complex real-world scenes. In this work, we introduce DNS SLAM, a novel neural RGB-D semantic SLAM approach featuring a hybrid representation. Relying only on 2D semantic priors, we propose the first semantic neural SLAM method that trains class-wise scene representations while providing stable camera tracking at the same time. Our method integrates multi-view geometry constraints with image-based feature extraction to improve appearance details and to output color, density, and semantic class information, enabling many downstream applications. To further enable real-time tracking, we introduce a lightweight coarse scene representation which is trained in a self-supervised manner in latent space. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real-world data tracking while maintaining a commendable operational speed on off-the-shelf hardware.

However, conventional loop closure methods based on low-level geometric or image features may cause high ambiguity by not distinguishing similar scenarios. Thus, incorrect loop closures can occur. Though semantic 2D image information is considered in some literature to detect loop closures, there is little work that compares 3D scenes as an integral part of a semantic SLAM system. This paper introduces an approach, called SmSLAM+LCD, integrated into a semantic SLAM system to combine high-level 3D semantic information and low-level feature information to conduct accurate loop closure detection and effective drift reduction.

| **[Autonomous Search of Semantic Objects in Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13236v2)** | 2023-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of enabling a robot to search for a semantic object, i.e., an object with a semantic label, in an unknown and GPS-denied environment. For the robot in the unknown environment to detect and find the target semantic object, it must perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) at both geometric and semantic levels using its onboard sensors while planning and executing its motion based on the ever-updated SLAM results. In other words, the robot must be able to conduct simultaneous localization, semantic mapping, motion planning, and execution in real-time in the presence of sensing and motion uncertainty. This is an open problem as it combines semantic SLAM based on perception and real-time motion planning and execution under uncertainty. Moreover, the goals of the robot motion change on the fly depending on whether and how the robot can detect the target object. We propose a novel approach to tackle the problem, leveraging semantic SLAM, Bayesian Networks, Markov Decision Process, and Real-Time Dynamic Programming. The results in simulation and real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In this research paper, we introduce 3DS-SLAM, 3D Semantic SLAM, tailored for dynamic scenes with visual 3D object detection. The 3DS-SLAM is a tightly-coupled algorithm resolving both semantic and geometric constraints sequentially. We designed a 3D part-aware hybrid transformer for point cloud-based object detection to identify dynamic objects. Subsequently, we propose a dynamic feature filter based on HDBSCAN clustering to extract objects with significant absolute depth differences. When compared against ORB-SLAM2, 3DS-SLAM exhibits an average improvement of 98.01% across the dynamic sequences of the TUM RGB-D dataset. Furthermore, it surpasses the performance of the other four leading SLAM systems designed for dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

This representation is storage-efficient, less ambiguous, and more informative, thus facilitating large-scale autonomy and the acquisition of actionable information in highly unstructured, GPS-denied environments. In this letter, we propose an integrated system that can perform large-scale autonomous flights and real-time semantic mapping in challenging under-canopy environments. We detect and model tree trunks and ground planes from LiDAR data, which are associated across scans and used to constrain robot poses as well as tree trunk models. The autonomous navigation module utilizes a multi-level planning and mapping framework and computes dynamically feasible trajectories that lead the UAV to build a semantic map of the user-defined region of interest in a computationally and storage efficient manner. A drift-compensation mechanism is designed to minimize the odometry drift using semantic SLAM outputs in real time, while maintaining planner optimality and controller stability. This leads the UAV to execute its mission accurately and safely at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Xu Li...</summary><p>Xu Liu and Guilherme V.

One of the key implicit assumptions when solving cooperative multi-robot problems is that all robots use the same (homogeneous) underlying algorithm. However, in practice, we want to allow collaboration between robots possessing different capabilities and that therefore must rely on heterogeneous algorithms. We present a system architecture and the supporting theory, to enable collaboration in a decentralized network of robots, where each robot relies on different estimation algorithms. To develop our approach, we focus on multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with multi-target tracking. Our theoretical framework builds on our idea of exploiting the conditional independence structure inherent to many robotics applications to separate between each robot's local inference (estimation) tasks and fuse only relevant parts of their non-equal, but overlapping probability density function (pdfs). We present a new decentralized graph-based approach to the multi-robot SLAM and tracking problem. We leverage factor graphs to split between different parts of the problem for efficient data sharing between robots in the network while enabling robots to use different local sparse landmark/dense/metric-semantic SLAM algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, presented at the ICRA 2023 workshop on "Distributed Graph Algorithms for Robotics"</p></details> |
| **[Neural Implicit Dense Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14560v2)** | 2023-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) is a widely used technique in robotics and computer vision that enables a robot to create a map of an unfamiliar environment using a camera sensor while simultaneously tracking its position over time. In this paper, we propose a novel RGBD vSLAM algorithm that can learn a memory-efficient, dense 3D geometry, and semantic segmentation of an indoor scene in an online manner. Our pipeline combines classical 3D vision-based tracking and loop closing with neural fields-based mapping. The mapping network learns the SDF of the scene as well as RGB, depth, and semantic maps of any novel view using only a set of keyframes. Additionally, we extend our pipeline to large scenes by using multiple local mapping networks. Extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets confirm that our approach provides robust tracking, mapping, and semantic labeling even with noisy, sparse, or no input depth. Overall, our proposed algorithm can greatly enhance scene perception and assist with a range of robot control problems.</p></details> |  |

Most CSLAM techniques rely on the transmission of low-level features for visual and LiDAR-based approaches, which are used for pose graph optimization. However, these low-level features can lead to incorrect loop closures, negatively impacting map generation.Recent approaches have proposed the use of high-level semantic information in the form of Hierarchical Semantic Graphs to improve the loop closure procedures and overall precision of SLAM algorithms. In this work, we present Multi S-Graphs, an S-graphs [1] based distributed CSLAM algorithm that utilizes high-level semantic information for cooperative map generation while minimizing the amount of information exchanged between robots.

Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.</p></details> |  |

Several SLAM systems with impressive performance have been invented and used during the last several decades. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as how to deal with moving objects in dynamic situations. Classic SLAM systems depend on the assumption of a static environment, which becomes unworkable in highly dynamic situations. Several methods have been presented to tackle this issue in recent years, but each has its limitations. This research combines the visual SLAM systems ORB-SLAM3 and Detectron2 to present the Det-SLAM system, which employs depth information and semantic segmentation to identify and eradicate dynamic spots to accomplish semantic SLAM for dynamic situations. Evaluation of public TUM datasets indicates that Det-SLAM is more resilient than previous dynamic SLAM systems and can lower the estimated error of camera posture in dynamic indoor scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Quadrics and cubes are often used to represent objects, but their single shape limits the accuracy of object map and thus affects the application of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce superquadrics (SQ) with shape parameters into SLAM for representing objects, and propose a separate parameter estimation method that can accurately estimate object pose and adapt to different shapes. Furthermore, we present a lightweight data association strategy for correctly associating semantic observations in multiple views with object landmarks. We implement a monocular semantic SLAM system with real-time performance and conduct comprehensive experiments on public datasets. The results show that our method is able to build accurate object map and has advantages in object representation.

The objects may be moved by inhabitants, but not completely at random. The robot may be called upon later to retrieve objects and will need a long-term object-based memory in order to know how to find them. Existing work in semantic slam does not attempt to capture the dynamics of object movement. In this paper, we combine some aspects of classic techniques for data-association filtering with modern attention-based neural networks to construct object-based memory systems that operate on high-dimensional observations and hypotheses. We perform end-to-end learning on labeled observation trajectories to learn both the transition and observation models. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining memory of dynamically changing objects in both simulated environment and real images, and demonstrate improvements over classical structured approaches as well as unstructured neural approaches.

One of the challenges in this field is to obtain object classification jointly with robot trajectory estimation. Considering view-dependent semantic measurements, there is a coupling between different classes, resulting in a combinatorial number of hypotheses. A common solution is to prune hypotheses that have a sufficiently low probability and to retain only a limited number of hypotheses. However, after pruning and renormalization, the updated probability is overconfident with respect to the original probability. This is especially problematic for systems that require high accuracy. If the prior probability of the classes is independent, the original normalization factor can be computed efficiently without pruning hypotheses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present these results. If the prior probability of the classes is dependent, we propose a lower bound on the normalization factor that ensures cautious results. The bound is calculated incrementally and with similar efficiency as in the independent case. After pruning and updating based on the bound, this belief is shown empirically to be close to the original belief.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, accepted to IROS</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose the use of an efficient representation, based on structural points, for the geometry of objects to be used as landmarks in a monocular semantic SLAM system based on the pose-graph formulation. In particular, an inverse depth parametrization is proposed for the landmark nodes in the pose-graph to store object position, orientation and size/scale. The proposed formulation is general and it can be applied to different geometries; in this paper we focus on indoor environments where human-made artifacts commonly share a planar rectangular shape, e.g., windows, doors, cabinets, etc. The approach can be easily extended to urban scenarios where similar shapes exists as well. Experiments in simulation show good performance, particularly in object geometry reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IROS 2015 (rejected)</p></details> |

Recently, however, the community has realized that progress towards robust intelligent systems such as self-driving cars requires a concerted effort across the different fields. This motivated us to develop KITTI-360, successor of the popular KITTI dataset. KITTI-360 is a suburban driving dataset which comprises richer input modalities, comprehensive semantic instance annotations and accurate localization to facilitate research at the intersection of vision, graphics and robotics. For efficient annotation, we created a tool to label 3D scenes with bounding primitives and developed a model that transfers this information into the 2D image domain, resulting in over 150k images and 1B 3D points with coherent semantic instance annotations across 2D and 3D. Moreover, we established benchmarks and baselines for several tasks relevant to mobile perception, encompassing problems from computer vision, graphics, and robotics on the same dataset, e.g., semantic scene understanding, novel view synthesis and semantic SLAM. KITTI-360 will enable progress at the intersection of these research areas and thus contribute towards solving one of today's grand challenges: the development of fully autonomous self-driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1511.03240</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Semantic SLAM for Complex Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04300v2)** | 2022-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most essential techniques in many real-world robotic applications. The assumption of static environments is common in most SLAM algorithms, which however, is not the case for most applications. Recent work on semantic SLAM aims to understand the objects in an environment and distinguish dynamic information from a scene context by performing image-based segmentation. However, the segmentation results are often imperfect or incomplete, which can subsequently reduce the quality of mapping and the accuracy of localization. In this paper, we present a robust multi-modal semantic framework to solve the SLAM problem in complex and highly dynamic environments. We propose to learn a more powerful object feature representation and deploy the mechanism of looking and thinking twice to the backbone network, which leads to a better recognition result to our baseline instance segmentation model. Moreover, both geometric-only clustering and visual semantic information are combined to reduce the effect of segmentation error due to small-scale objects, occlusion and motion blur. Thorough experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method can precisely identify dynamic objects under recognition imperfection and motion blur. Moreover, the proposed SLAM framework is able to efficiently build a static dense map at a processing rate of more than 10 Hz, which can be implemented in many practical applications. Both training data and the proposed method is open sourced at https://github.com/wh200720041/MMS_SLAM.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a method for semantic dense reconstruction of the OR scene using multiple RGB-D cameras attached and registered to the da Vinci Xi surgical system. We developed a novel SLAM approach for robot pose tracking in dynamic OR environments and dense reconstruction of the static OR table object. We validated our techniques in a mock OR by collecting data sequences with corresponding optical tracking trajectories as ground truth and manually annotated 100 frame segmentation masks. The mean absolute trajectory error is $11.4\pm1.9$ mm and the mean relative pose error is $1.53\pm0.48$ degrees per second. The segmentation DICE score is improved from 0.814 to 0.902 by using our SLAM system compared to single frame. Our approach effectively produces a dense OR table reconstruction in dynamic clinical environments as well as improved semantic segmentation on individual image frames.</p></details> |  |

Previously, SLAM was carried out using lower level geometric features (points, lines, and planes) which are often view-point dependent and error prone in visually repetitive environments. Semantic information can improve the ability to recognise previously visited locations, as well as maintain sparser maps for long term SLAM applications. However, SLAM in repetitive environments has the critical problem of assigning measurements to the landmarks which generated them. In this paper, we use k-best assignment enumeration to compute marginal assignment probabilities for each measurement landmark pair, in real time. We present numerical studies on the KITTI dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 3 figures, submitted to Robotics and Automation Letters and the IROS 2020 conference</p></details> |
| **[Perception-Based Temporal Logic Planning in Uncertain Semantic Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10490v3)** | 2022-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses a multi-robot planning problem in environments with partially unknown semantics. The environment is assumed to have known geometric structure (e.g., walls) and to be occupied by static labeled landmarks with uncertain positions and classes. This modeling approach gives rise to an uncertain semantic map generated by semantic SLAM algorithms. Our goal is to design control policies for robots equipped with noisy perception systems so that they can accomplish collaborative tasks captured by global temporal logic specifications. To specify missions that account for environmental and perceptual uncertainty, we employ a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), called co-safe LTL, defined over perception-based atomic predicates modeling probabilistic satisfaction requirements. The perception-based LTL planning problem gives rise to an optimal control problem, solved by a novel sampling-based algorithm, that generates open-loop control policies that are updated online to adapt to a continuously learned semantic map. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed planning architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate Object Association and Pose Updating for Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11368v3)** | 2021-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current pandemic has caused the medical system to operate under high load. To relieve it, robots with high autonomy can be used to effectively execute contactless operations in hospitals and reduce cross-infection between medical staff and patients. Although semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology can improve the autonomy of robots, semantic object association is still a problem that is worthy of being studied. The key to solving this problem is to correctly associate multiple object measurements of one object landmark by using semantic information, and to refine the pose of object landmark in real time. To this end, we propose a hierarchical object association strategy and a pose-refinement approach. The former one consists of two levels, i.e., a short-term object association and a global one. In the first level, we employ the multiple-object-tracking for short-term object association, through which the incorrect association among objects whose locations are close and appearances are similar can be avoided. Moreover, the short-term object association can provide more abundant object appearance and more robust estimation of object pose for the global object association in the second level. To refine the object pose in the map, we develop an approach to choose the optimal object pose from all object measurements associated with an object landmark. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on seven simulated hospital sequences1, a real hospital environment and the KITTI dataset. Experimental results show that our method has an obviously improvement in terms of robustness and accuracy for the object association and the trajectory estimation in the semantic SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Kimera-Multi is implemented by a team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local trajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose graph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated non-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques. We demonstrate Kimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking datasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both real and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800 meters per robot). The experiments show that Kimera-Multi (i) outperforms the state of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy, (ii) achieves estimation errors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed, (iii) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth, (iv) produces accurate metric-semantic 3D meshes, and (v) is modular and can be also used for standard 3D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory estimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3D mesh).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (18 pages, 15 figures)</p></details> |

However, how semantic objects should be represented for an efficient inclusion in optimization-based SLAM frameworks is still an open question. Superquadrics(SQs) are an efficient and compact object representation, able to represent most common object types to a high degree, and typically retrieved from 3D point-cloud data. However, accurate 3D point-cloud data might not be available in all applications. Recent advancements in machine learning enabled robust object recognition and semantic mask measurements from camera images under many different appearance conditions. We propose a pipeline to leverage such semantic mask measurements to fit SQ parameters to multi-view camera observations using a multi-stage initialization and optimization procedure. We demonstrate the system's ability to retrieve randomly generated SQ parameters from multi-view mask observations in preliminary simulation experiments and evaluate different initialization stages and cost functions.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we present a multi-camera system where a side camera (facing the plants) is used for detection whereas front and back cameras are used for motion estimation. Next, we show how semantic features in the environment (corn stalks, ground, and crop planes) can be used to develop a robust semantic SLAM solution and present results from field trials performed throughout the growing season across various cornfields.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

We contribute a unified framework for inference and belief space planning (BSP) that addresses prominent sources of uncertainty in this context: classification aliasing (classier cannot distinguish between candidate classes from certain viewpoints), classifier epistemic uncertainty (classifier receives data "far" from its training set), and localization uncertainty (camera and object poses are uncertain). Specifically, we develop two methods for maintaining a joint distribution over robot and object poses, and over posterior class probability vector that considers epistemic uncertainty in a Bayesian fashion. The first approach is Multi-Hybrid (MH), where multiple hybrid beliefs over poses and classes are maintained to approximate the joint belief over poses and posterior class probability. The second approach is Joint Lambda Pose (JLP), where the joint belief is maintained directly using a novel JLP factor. Furthermore, we extend both methods to BSP, planning while reasoning about future posterior epistemic uncertainty indirectly, or directly via a novel information-theoretic reward function. Both inference methods utilize a novel viewpoint-dependent classifier uncertainty model that leverages the coupling between poses and classification scores and predicts the epistemic uncertainty from certain viewpoints. In addition, this model is used to generate predicted measurements during planning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reasons about classifier epistemic uncertainty within semantic SLAM and BSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 38 figures, submitted to Autonomous Robots Journal (ARJ)</p></details> |

Besides geometric information about the mapped environment, the semantics plays an important role to enable intelligent navigation behaviors. In most realistic environments, this task is particularly complicated due to dynamics caused by moving objects, which can corrupt the mapping step or derail localization. In this paper, we propose an extension of a recently published surfel-based mapping approach exploiting three-dimensional laser range scans by integrating semantic information to facilitate the mapping process. The semantic information is efficiently extracted by a fully convolutional neural network and rendered on a spherical projection of the laser range data. This computed semantic segmentation results in point-wise labels for the whole scan, allowing us to build a semantically-enriched map with labeled surfels. This semantic map enables us to reliably filter moving objects, but also improve the projective scan matching via semantic constraints. Our experimental evaluation on challenging highways sequences from KITTI dataset with very few static structures and a large amount of moving cars shows the advantage of our semantic SLAM approach in comparison to a purely geometric, state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2019.

| **[Multiple Hypothesis Semantic Mapping for Robust Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04423v1)** | 2020-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a semantic mapping approach with multiple hypothesis tracking for data association. As semantic information has the potential to overcome ambiguity in measurements and place recognition, it forms an eminent modality for autonomous systems. This is particularly evident in urban scenarios with several similar looking surroundings. Nevertheless, it requires the handling of a non-Gaussian and discrete random variable coming from object detectors. Previous methods facilitate semantic information for global localization and data association to reduce the instance ambiguity between the landmarks. However, many of these approaches do not deal with the creation of complete globally consistent representations of the environment and typically do not scale well. We utilize multiple hypothesis trees to derive a probabilistic data association for semantic measurements by means of position, instance and class to create a semantic representation. We propose an optimized mapping method and make use of a pose graph to derive a novel semantic SLAM solution. Furthermore, we show that semantic covisibility graphs allow for a precise place recognition in urban environments. We verify our approach using real-world outdoor dataset and demonstrate an average drift reduction of 33 % w.r.t. the raw odometry source. Moreover, our approach produces 55 % less hypotheses on average than a regular multiple hypotheses approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic SLAM with Autonomous Object-Level Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10625v1)** | 2020-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often desirable to capture and map semantic information of an environment during simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Such semantic information can enable a robot to better distinguish places with similar low-level geometric and visual features and perform high-level tasks that use semantic information about objects to be manipulated and environments to be navigated. While semantic SLAM has gained increasing attention, there is little research on semanticlevel data association based on semantic objects, i.e., object-level data association. In this paper, we propose a novel object-level data association algorithm based on bag of words algorithm, formulated as a maximum weighted bipartite matching problem. With object-level data association solved, we develop a quadratic-programming-based semantic object initialization scheme using dual quadric and introduce additional constraints to improve the success rate of object initialization. The integrated semantic-level SLAM system can achieve high-accuracy object-level data association and real-time semantic mapping as demonstrated in the experiments. The online semantic map building and semantic-level localization capabilities facilitate semantic-level mapping and task planning in a priori unknown environment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an ensemble data associate strategy for integrating the parametric and nonparametric statistic tests. By exploiting the nature of different statistics, our method can effectively aggregate the information of different measurements, and thus significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of data association. We then present an accurate object pose estimation framework, in which an outliers-robust centroid and scale estimation algorithm and an object pose initialization algorithm are developed to help improve the optimality of pose estimation results. Furthermore, we build a SLAM system that can generate semi-dense or lightweight object-oriented maps with a monocular camera.

Our approach addresses such a setting by maintaining a distributed posterior hybrid belief over continuous localization and discrete classification variables. In particular, we utilize a viewpoint-dependent classifier model to leverage the coupling between semantics and geometry. Moreover, our approach yields a consistent estimation of both continuous and discrete variables, with the latter being addressed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. We evaluate the performance of our approach in a multi-robot semantic SLAM simulation and in a real-world experiment, demonstrating an increase in both classification and localization accuracy compared to maintaining a hybrid belief using local information only.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 73 figures, for an associated video, see https://youtu.be/jATog1snfwc</p></details> |

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS- Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Traditional SLAM approaches rely heavily on low-level geometric constraints like corners or lines, which may lead to tracking failure in textureless surroundings or cluttered world with dynamic objects. In this paper, a compact semantic SLAM framework is proposed, with utilization of both geometric and object-level semantic constraints jointly, a more consistent mapping result, and more accurate pose estimation can be obtained. Two main contributions are presented int the paper, a) a robust and efficient SLAM data association and optimization framework is proposed, it models both discrete semantic labeling and continuous pose. b) a compact map representation, combining 2D Lidar map with object detection is presented. Experiments on public indoor datasets, TUM-RGBD, ICL-NUIM, and our own collected datasets prove the improving of SLAM robustness and accuracy compared to other popular SLAM systems, meanwhile a map maintenance efficiency can be achieved.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

We aim to develop robots that can use all of these sources of information for reliable navigation, but each is corrupted by noise. Rather than assume that object detection will eventually achieve near perfect performance across the lifetime of a robot, in this work we represent and cope with the semantic and geometric uncertainty inherent in methods like object detection. Specifically, we model data association ambiguity, which is typically non-Gaussian, in a way that is amenable to solution within the common nonlinear Gaussian formulation of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We do so by eliminating data association variables from the inference process through max-marginalization, preserving standard Gaussian posterior assumptions. The result is a max-mixture-type model that accounts for multiple data association hypotheses as well as incorrect loop closures. We provide experimental results on indoor and outdoor semantic navigation tasks with noisy odometry and object detection and find that the ability of the proposed approach to represent multiple hypotheses, including the "null" hypothesis, gives substantial robustness advantages in comparison to alternative semantic SLAM approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors D.

Our dataset serves a wider range of purposes compared to existing datasets and is the first large-scale benchmark focused on the mapping component of SLAM. The dataset is split into train/validation/test parts sampled from different sets of virtual houses.

While sparse point-based SLAM methods provide accurate camera localization, the generated maps lack semantic information. On the other hand, state of the art object detection methods provide rich information about entities present in the scene from a single image. This work incorporates a real-time deep-learned object detector to the monocular SLAM framework for representing generic objects as quadrics that permit detections to be seamlessly integrated while allowing the real-time performance. Finer reconstruction of an object, learned by a CNN network, is also incorporated and provides a shape prior for the quadric leading further refinement. To capture the dominant structure of the scene, additional planar landmarks are detected by a CNN-based plane detector and modeled as independent landmarks in the map. Extensive experiments support our proposed inclusion of semantic objects and planar structures directly in the bundle-adjustment of SLAM - Semantic SLAM - that enriches the reconstructed map semantically, while significantly improving the camera localization.

| **[Efficient Constellation-Based Map-Merging for Semantic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09646v2)** | 2019-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data association in SLAM is fundamentally challenging, and handling ambiguity well is crucial to achieve robust operation in real-world environments. When ambiguous measurements arise, conservatism often mandates that the measurement is discarded or a new landmark is initialized rather than risking an incorrect association. To address the inevitable `duplicate' landmarks that arise, we present an efficient map-merging framework to detect duplicate constellations of landmarks, providing a high-confidence loop-closure mechanism well-suited for object-level SLAM. This approach uses an incrementally-computable approximation of landmark uncertainty that only depends on local information in the SLAM graph, avoiding expensive recovery of the full system covariance matrix. This enables a search based on geometric consistency (GC) (rather than full joint compatibility (JC)) that inexpensively reduces the search space to a handful of `best' hypotheses. Furthermore, we reformulate the commonly-used interpretation tree to allow for more efficient integration of clique-based pairwise compatibility, accelerating the branch-and-bound max-cardinality search. Our method is demonstrated to match the performance of full JC methods at significantly-reduced computational cost, facilitating robust object-based loop-closure over large SLAM problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2019</p></details> |

Recent studies on object detection and feature extraction have become important for scene understanding and 3D mapping. However, 3D shape of the object is too complex to formulate the probabilistic observation model; therefore, performing the Bayesian inference of the object-oriented features as well as their pose is less considered. Besides, when the robot equipped with an RGB mono camera only observes the projected single view of an object, a significant amount of the 3D shape information is abandoned. Due to these limitations, semantic SLAM and viewpoint-independent loop closure using volumetric 3D object shape is challenging. In order to enable the complete formulation of probabilistic semantic SLAM, we approximate the observation model of a 3D object with a tractable distribution. We also estimate the variational likelihood from the 2D image of the object to exploit its observed single view. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we perform pose and feature estimation, and demonstrate that the automatic loop closure works seamlessly without additional loop detector in various environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to ICRA 2018</p></details> |

Recent approaches to object recognition methods become important for semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, there is a lack of consideration of the probabilistic observation model for 3D objects, as the shape of a 3D object basically follows a complex probability distribution. Furthermore, since the mobile robot equipped with a range sensor observes only a single view, much information of the object shape is discarded. These limitations are the major obstacles to semantic SLAM and view-independent loop closure using 3D object shapes as features. In order to enable the numerical analysis for the Bayesian inference, we approximate the true observation model of 3D objects to tractable distributions. Since the observation likelihood can be obtained from the generative model, we formulate the true generative model for 3D object with the Bayesian networks. To capture these complex distributions, we apply a variational auto-encoder. To analyze the approximated distributions and encoded features, we perform classification with maximum likelihood estimation and shape retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in the proceedings of IROS 2018</p></details> |

This is especially important in ego-centric tasks where obtaining 3 dimensional information is both limiting and challenging with the current 2D video analysis methods proving insufficient. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept system which provides real-time 3D mapping and semantic labeling of the local environment from an ego-centric RGB-D video-stream with 3D gaze point estimation from head mounted eye tracking glasses. We augment existing work in Semantic Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (Semantic SLAM) with collected gaze vectors. Our system can then find and track objects both inside and outside the user field-of-view in 3D from multiple perspectives with reasonable accuracy. We validate our concept by producing a semantic map from images of the NYUv2 dataset while simultaneously estimating gaze position and gaze classes from recorded gaze data of the dataset images.</p></details> |  |

Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, pose-free observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of large complex scenes (with high degree of foreground and background detail) with known camera poses using view-conditioned generative priors, these methods cannot be directly adapted for the pose-free setting when ground-truth poses are not available during evaluation. To address this, we propose an image-to-image generative model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We introduce context and geometry conditioning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation layers as a lightweight alternative to cross-attention and also propose a novel confidence measure for 3D Gaussian splat representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent 3D representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 and DL3DV-10K benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed (precomputed camera parameters are given) reconstruction methods in complex 360 scenes. Our project page provides additional results, videos, and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2025.

However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce an advanced semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both Intra-level and Inter-level optimizations. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system.

Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework. Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, their sequential optimization framework and sensitivity to dynamic objects limit real-time performance and robustness in real-world scenarios. We present UP-SLAM, a real-time RGB-D SLAM system for dynamic environments that decouples tracking and mapping through a parallelized framework. A probabilistic octree is employed to manage Gaussian primitives adaptively, enabling efficient initialization and pruning without hand-crafted thresholds. To robustly filter dynamic regions during tracking, we propose a training-free uncertainty estimator that fuses multi-modal residuals to estimate per-pixel motion uncertainty, achieving open-set dynamic object handling without reliance on semantic labels. Furthermore, a temporal encoder is designed to enhance rendering quality. Concurrently, low-dimensional features are efficiently transformed via a shallow multilayer perceptron to construct DINO features, which are then employed to enrich the Gaussian field and improve the robustness of uncertainty prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets suggest that UP-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy (by 59.8%) and rendering quality (by 4.57 dB PSNR), while maintaining real-time performance and producing reusable, artifact-free static maps in dynamic environments.The project: https://aczheng-cai.github.io/up_slam.github.io/</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods are all constrained to small-room scenarios and struggle with memory explosion in large-scale scenes and long sequences. To this end, we propose VPGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-based large-scale RGBD SLAM framework for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. We design a novel voxel-based progressive 3D Gaussian mapping method with multiple submaps for compact and accurate scene representation in large-scale and long-sequence scenes. This allows us to scale up to arbitrary scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In addition, we propose a 2D-3D fusion camera tracking method to achieve robust and accurate camera tracking in both indoor and outdoor large-scale scenes. Furthermore, we design a 2D-3D Gaussian loop closure method to eliminate pose drift. We further propose a submap fusion method with online distillation to achieve global consistency in large-scale scenes when detecting a loop. Experiments on various indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the proposed framework.

Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art.

To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy.

Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)</p></details> |  |

However, current methods either lack dense depth maps to supervise the mapping process or detailed training designs that consider the scale of the environment. To address these drawbacks, we present IG-SLAM, a dense RGB-only SLAM system that employs robust Dense-SLAM methods for tracking and combines them with Gaussian Splatting. A 3D map of the environment is constructed using accurate pose and dense depth provided by tracking. Additionally, we utilize depth uncertainty in map optimization to improve 3D reconstruction. Our decay strategy in map optimization enhances convergence and allows the system to run at 10 fps in a single process. We demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art RGB-only SLAM systems while achieving faster operation speeds. We present our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and EuRoC datasets. The system achieves photo-realistic 3D reconstruction in large-scale sequences, particularly in the EuRoC dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 page ref, 5 figures</p></details> |

Existing methods have achieved encouraging results on RGB-D SLAM, but studies of the monocular case are still scarce. Moreover, they also fail to correct drift errors due to the lack of loop closure and global optimization. In this paper, we present MG-SLAM, a monocular Gaussian SLAM with a language-extended loop closure module capable of performing drift-corrected tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction while achieving a high-level understanding of the environment. Our key idea is to represent the global map as 3D Gaussian and use it to guide the estimation of the scene geometry, thus mitigating the efforts of missing depth information. Further, an additional language-extended loop closure module which is based on CLIP feature is designed to continually perform global optimization to correct drift errors accumulated as the system runs. Our system shows promising results on multiple challenging datasets in both tracking and mapping and even surpasses some existing RGB-D methods.</p></details> |  |

The system features a compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the state-of-the-art NeRF-based RGBD SLAM, our system achieves comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the speed and half the memory cost, and shows superior performance in the realism of novel view synthesis and camera tracking accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ACM SIGGRAPH 2024</p></details> |

However, real-time full posterior inference techniques, such as Gaussian approximation and particle filters, either lack expressiveness for representing non-Gaussian posteriors or suffer from performance degeneracy when estimating high-dimensional posteriors. Inspired by the complementary strengths of Gaussian approximation and particle filters$\unicode{x2013}$scalability and non-Gaussian estimation, respectively$\unicode{x2013}$we blend these two approaches to infer marginal posteriors in SLAM. Specifically, Gaussian approximation provides robot pose distributions on which particle filters are conditioned to sample landmark marginals. In return, the maximum a posteriori point among these samples can be used to reset linearization points in the nonlinear optimization solver of the Gaussian approximation, facilitating the pursuit of global optima. We demonstrate the scalability, generalizability, and accuracy of our algorithm for real-time full posterior inference on realworld range-only SLAM and object-based bearing-only SLAM datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Nested Sampling for Non-Gaussian Inference in SLAM Factor Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10871v3)** | 2022-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present nested sampling for factor graphs (NSFG), a novel nested sampling approach to approximate inference for posterior distributions expressed over factor-graphs. Performing such inference is a key step in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Although the Gaussian approximation often works well, in other more challenging SLAM situations, the posterior distribution is non-Gaussian and cannot be explicitly represented with standard distributions. Our technique applies to settings where the posterior distribution is substantially non-Gaussian (e.g., multi-modal) and thus needs a more expressive representation. NSFG exploits nested sampling methods to directly sample the posterior to represent the distribution without parametric density models. While nested sampling methods are known for their powerful capability in sampling multi-modal distributions, the application of the methods to SLAM factor graphs is not straightforward. NSFG leverages the structure of factor graphs to construct informative prior distributions which are efficiently sampled and provide notable computational benefits for nested sampling methods. We present simulated experiments which demonstrate that NSFG is more robust and computes solutions over an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art sampling techniques. Similarly, we compare NSFG to state-of-the-art Gaussian and non-Gaussian SLAM approaches and demonstrate that NSFG is notably more robust in describing non-Gaussian posteriors.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce 4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread. The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate 4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex scenes.</p></details> |  |

This could revolutionize applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and scientific simulation. However, before treating these models as world models, we must ask: Do they adhere to physical conservation laws? To answer this, we introduce Morpheus, a benchmark for evaluating video generation models on physical reasoning. It features 80 real-world videos capturing physical phenomena, guided by conservation laws. Since artificial generations lack ground truth, we assess physical plausibility using physics-informed metrics evaluated with respect to infallible conservation laws known per physical setting, leveraging advances in physics-informed neural networks and vision-language foundation models. Our findings reveal that even with advanced prompting and video conditioning, current models struggle to encode physical principles despite generating aesthetically pleasing videos.

However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance, while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across both benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, how a language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions. First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities, critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned, trustworthy LLM explanations.</p></details> |  |

We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making.

In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited 3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.</p></details> |  |

However, their large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding, which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet</p></details> |  |

However, these simulations are non-differentiable, forcing researchers to create attacks that do not integrate simulation environmental factors, reducing attack success. To address this limitation, we introduce UNDREAM, the first software framework that bridges the gap between photorealistic simulators and differentiable renderers to enable end-to-end optimization of adversarial perturbations on any 3D objects. UNDREAM enables manipulation of the environment by offering complete control over weather, lighting, backgrounds, camera angles, trajectories, and realistic human and object movements, thereby allowing the creation of diverse scenes. We showcase a wide array of distinct physically plausible adversarial objects that UNDREAM enables researchers to swiftly explore in different configurable environments. This combination of photorealistic simulation and differentiable optimization opens new avenues for advancing research of physical adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, a common ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes, which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds. To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do so, often trained on simulated data. However, existing RL frameworks overlook occasional server failures, which although rare, impact latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and real-time obstacle detection. Nevertheless, these failures (rare events), being not adequately represented in historical training data, pose a challenge for data-driven RL algorithms. As it is impractical to adjust failure frequency in real-world applications for training, we introduce FIRE, a framework that adapts to rare events by training a RL policy in an edge computing digital twin environment. We propose ImRE, an importance sampling-based Q-learning algorithm, which samples rare events proportionally to their impact on the value function. FIRE considers delay, migration, failure, and backup placement costs across individual and shared service profiles. We prove ImRE's boundedness and convergence to optimality. Next, we introduce novel deep Q-learning (ImDQL) and actor critic (ImACRE) versions of our algorithm to enhance scalability. We extend our framework to accommodate users with varying risk tolerances. Through trace driven experiments, we show that FIRE reduces costs compared to vanilla RL and the greedy baseline in the event of failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Services Computing</p></details> |

Although traditional object detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition, we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.</p></details> | Neurocomputing |

Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model.

Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object detection through object specific transformations at both training and inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic, diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and inference respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 Workshops</p></details> |

| **[Perfect Prediction or Plenty of Proposals? What Matters Most in Planning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15505v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.</p></details> | 1st version |
| **[FreqPDE: Rethinking Positional Depth Embedding for Multi-View 3D Object Detection Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15385v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism. Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and 3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |

Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoStreamer: Temporal Lane Segment Topology Reasoning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00709v4)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cooperative perception in extending the perception range and overcoming occlusions, thereby enhancing the safety of autonomous driving. In recent years, a series of cooperative perception datasets have emerged; however, these datasets primarily focus on cameras and LiDAR, neglecting 4D Radar, a sensor used in single-vehicle autonomous driving to provide robust perception in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, to bridge the gap created by the absence of 4D Radar datasets in cooperative perception, we present V2X-Radar, the first large-scale, real-world multi-modal dataset featuring 4D Radar. V2X-Radar dataset is collected using a connected vehicle platform and an intelligent roadside unit equipped with 4D Radar, LiDAR, and multi-view cameras. The collected data encompasses sunny and rainy weather conditions, spanning daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as various typical challenging scenarios. The dataset consists of 20K LiDAR frames, 40K camera images, and 20K 4D Radar data, including 350K annotated boxes across five categories. To support various research domains, we have established V2X-Radar-C for cooperative perception, V2X-Radar-I for roadside perception, and V2X-Radar-V for single-vehicle perception. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive benchmarks across these three sub-datasets. We will release all datasets and benchmark codebase at http://openmpd.com/column/V2X-Radar and https://github.com/yanglei18/V2X-Radar.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[An Intention-driven Lane Change Framework Considering Heterogeneous Dynamic Cooperation in Mixed-traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22550v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging. Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-supervised Multi-future Occupancy Forecasting for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21126v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environment prediction frameworks are critical for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dynamic settings. LiDAR-generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's-eye view for the scene representation, enabling self-supervised joint scene predictions while exhibiting resilience to partial observability and perception detection failures. Prior approaches have focused on deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures within the grid cell space. While these methods have seen some success, they frequently produce unrealistic predictions and fail to capture the stochastic nature of the environment. Additionally, they do not effectively integrate additional sensor modalities present in AVs. Our proposed framework, Latent Occupancy Prediction (LOPR), performs stochastic L-OGM prediction in the latent space of a generative architecture and allows for conditioning on RGB cameras, maps, and planned trajectories. We decode predictions using either a single-step decoder, which provides high-quality predictions in real-time, or a diffusion-based batch decoder, which can further refine the decoded frames to address temporal consistency issues and reduce compression losses. Our experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets show that all variants of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively outperform prior approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[CoDS: Enhancing Collaborative Perception in Heterogeneous Scenarios via Domain Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13432v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively. Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios. The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation (DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI) loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |
| **[WorldSplat: Gaussian-Centric Feed-Forward 4D Scene Generation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23402v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose WorldSplat, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: (i) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. (ii) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WorldSplat effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

This requires building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data. Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/simuli</p></details> |

However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images. SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation. CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization.

With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

| **[Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01545v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

Scenic, a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs) suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14 prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics (compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11). EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88 percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting, Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options for autonomous-driving scenario programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant (de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering, liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows 95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from 521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h) on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

In order to improve the robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial attack, such as state observation attacks.</p></details> |  |

Central to this task are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often \textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or \textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding. Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3 in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art.

These large-scale datasets are often dominated by common environmental conditions such as "Clear and Day" weather, leading to decreased performance in under-represented conditions like "Rainy and Night". To address this issue, we introduce SynDiff-AD, a novel data augmentation pipeline that leverages diffusion models (DMs) to generate realistic images for such subgroups. SynDiff-AD uses ControlNet-a DM that guides data generation conditioned on semantic maps-along with a novel prompting scheme that generates subgroup-specific, semantically dense prompts. By augmenting datasets with SynDiff-AD, we improve the performance of segmentation models like Mask2Former and SegFormer by up to 1.2% and 2.3% on the Waymo dataset, and up to 1.4% and 0.7% on the DeepDrive dataset, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that our SynDiff-AD pipeline enhances the driving performance of end-to-end autonomous driving models, like AIM-2D and AIM-BEV, by up to 20% across diverse environmental conditions in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, providing a more robust model.

To address this, we propose the Hints of Prompt (HoP) framework, which introduces three key enhancements: Affinity hint to emphasize instance-level structure by strengthening token-wise connections, Semantic hint to incorporate high-level information relevant to driving-specific cases, such as complex interactions among vehicles and traffic signs, and Question hint to align visual features with the query context, focusing on question-relevant regions. These hints are fused through a Hint Fusion module, enriching visual representations by capturing driving-related representations with limited domain data, ensuring faster adaptation to driving scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the HoP framework, showing that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in all key metrics.</p></details> |  |

Their acceleration features, such as caches and pipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a probabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability threshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This paper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results of probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively more advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task set partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned scheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates that the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis time compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The evaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric Worst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.</p></details> |  |

However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack (SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance. We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its attacks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Hi-Drive, a hierarchical planning algorithm addressing uncertainties at both behavior and trajectory levels using a hierarchical Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation. Hi-Drive employs driver models to represent uncertain behavioral intentions of other vehicles and uses their parameters to infer hidden driving styles. By treating driver models as high-level decision-making actions, our approach effectively manages the exponential complexity inherent in POMDPs. To further enhance safety and robustness, Hi-Drive integrates a trajectory optimization based on importance sampling, refining trajectories using a comprehensive analysis of critical agents. Evaluations on real-world urban driving datasets demonstrate that Hi-Drive significantly outperforms state-of-the-art planning-based and learning-based methods across diverse urban driving situations in real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analytical Framework to Enhance Autonomous Vehicle Perception for Smart Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13230v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles (AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models' performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e., SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.) still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892, truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values, confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 14 figures |

Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in 2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and will be released https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc</p></details> |  |

To enable meaningful assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context. By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories: non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction, collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the real-world performance of driving agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Driving in Occluded Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13114v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safe autonomous driving in the presence of occlusions poses a significant challenge in its policy design. While existing model-driven control techniques based on set invariance can handle visible risks, occlusions create latent risks in which safety-critical states are not observable. Data-driven techniques also struggle to handle latent risks because direct mappings from risk-critical objects in sensor inputs to safe actions cannot be learned without visible risk-critical objects. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic safety certificate for latent risk. Our key technical enabler is the application of probabilistic invariance: It relaxes the strict observability requirements imposed by set-invariance methods that demand the knowledge of risk-critical states. The proposed techniques provide linear action constraints that confine the latent risk probability within tolerance. Such constraints can be integrated into model predictive controllers or embedded in data-driven policies to mitigate latent risks. The proposed method is tested using the CARLA simulator and compared with a few existing techniques. The theoretical and empirical analysis jointly demonstrate that the proposed methods assure long-term safety in real-time control in occluded environments without being overly conservative and with transparency to exposed risks.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context. Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation to evaluating autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Consequently, obstacle detection latency is critical to the safety and effectiveness of autonomous driving systems. However, the latency of the obstacle detection module and its resilience to various changes in the LiDAR point cloud data are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive investigation on measuring and modeling the performance of the obstacle detection modules in two industry-grade autonomous driving systems, i.e., Apollo and Autoware. Learning from this investigation, we introduce ADPerf, a tool that aims to generate realistic point cloud data test cases that can expose increased detection latency. Increasing latency decreases the availability of the detected obstacles and stresses the capabilities of subsequent modules in autonomous driving systems, i.e., the modules may be negatively impacted by the increased latency in obstacle detection. We applied ADPerf to stress-test the performance of widely used 3D obstacle detection modules in autonomous driving systems, as well as the propagation of such tests on trajectory prediction modules. Our evaluation highlights the need to conduct performance testing of obstacle detection components, especially 3D obstacle detection, as they can be a major bottleneck to increased latency of the autonomous driving system. Such an adverse outcome will also further propagate to other modules, reducing the overall reliability of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  |

Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |
| **[On the Robustness Evaluation of 3D Obstacle Detection Against Specifications in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13653v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) rely on real-time sensor data, such as cameras and LiDARs, for time-critical decisions using deep neural networks. The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios.

To achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent decision-making framework in complex scenarios.

However, existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion. CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.</p></details> |  |

This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects, while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS.</p></details> |  |

Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the first time, angle-based perception was introduced into the multi-modality image fusion task</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into ADSs to support high-level decision-making through their powerful reasoning, instruction-following, and communication abilities. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs leverage language-driven communication and coordination to enhance inter-agent collaboration. This paper provides a frontier survey of this emerging intersection between NLP and multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based methods based on different agent interaction modes. We then discuss agent-human interactions in scenarios where LLM-based agents engage with humans.

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our model in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous driving. This dataset establishes a framework for robust, interpretable, and data-driven autonomous driving systems by providing a comprehensive platform for training and evaluating VLA models, contributing to safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles.

While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.</p></details> |  |

We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> |

Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has been utilized in numerous robotic applications due to its appealing characteristics to solve non-convex optimization problems. However, the stochastic nature of sampling-based methods can cause significant chattering in the resulting commands. Chattering becomes more prominent in cases where the environment changes rapidly, possibly even causing the MPPI to diverge. To address this issue, we propose a method that seamlessly combines MPPI with an input-lifting strategy. In addition, we introduce a new action cost to smooth control sequence during trajectory rollouts while preserving the information theoretic interpretation of MPPI, which was derived from non-affine dynamics. We validate our method in two nonlinear control tasks with neural network dynamics: a pendulum swing-up task and a challenging autonomous driving task.

However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</p></details> |  |

For these vehicles, as well as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics. In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICAR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Data Scaling Laws for Imitation Learning-Based End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02689v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The end-to-end autonomous driving paradigm has recently attracted lots of attention due to its scalability. However, existing methods are constrained by the limited scale of real-world data, which hinders a comprehensive exploration of the scaling laws associated with end-to-end autonomous driving. To address this issue, we collected substantial data from various driving scenarios and behaviors and conducted an extensive study on the scaling laws of existing imitation learning-based end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms. Specifically, approximately 4 million demonstrations from 23 different scenario types were gathered, amounting to over 30,000 hours of driving demonstrations. We performed open-loop evaluations and closed-loop simulation evaluations in 1,400 diverse driving demonstrations (1,300 for open-loop and 100 for closed-loop) under stringent assessment conditions. Through experimental analysis, we discovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law relationship with the amount of data, but this is not the case in closed-loop evaluation. The inconsistency between the two assessments shifts our focus toward the distribution of data rather than merely expanding its volume. (2) a small increase in the quantity of long-tailed data can significantly improve the performance for the corresponding scenarios; (3) appropriate scaling of data enables the model to achieve combinatorial generalization in novel scenes and actions. Our results highlight the critical role of data scaling in improving the generalizability of models across diverse autonomous driving scenarios, assuring safe deployment in the real world..

| **[Future-Aware End-to-End Driving: Bidirectional Modeling of Trajectory Planning and Scene Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11092v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Flow Matching-Based Autonomous Driving Planning with Advanced Interactive Behavior Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11083v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models, removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation, which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Vision-Language Cross-Attention for Real-Time Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Game-Theoretic Risk-Shaped Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10960v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge, especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety, efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L) framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate, collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/DanielHu197/GTR2L.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neutral Agent-based Adversarial Policy Learning against Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-party Open Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10937v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and dependent on interactions with victim agents. To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the limited number of instances in some rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stability Under Scrutiny: Benchmarking Representation Paradigms for Online HD Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10660v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy, while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at https://stablehdmap.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Machine Learning Perspective on Automated Driving Corner Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10653v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually. However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition, underlining our manual specification-free definition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-based Dynamic Adaptation for Sampling-Based Motion Planning in Agile Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10567v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling-based trajectory planners are widely used for agile autonomous driving due to their ability to generate fast, smooth, and kinodynamically feasible trajectories. However, their behavior is often governed by a cost function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning for broader autonomous driving applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to the IEEE ICRA 2026, Vienna, Austria</p></details> |
| **[Align2Act: Instruction-Tuned Models for Human-Aligned Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10503v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and 66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM planners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating YOLO Architectures: Implications for Real-Time Vehicle Detection in Urban Environments of Bangladesh](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05652v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Budgeted Control Framework for Balanced Performance and Safety in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10442v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a risk-budgeted monitor with a control framework that certifies safety for autonomous driving. In this process, a sliding window is proposed to monitor for insufficient barrier residuals or nonzero tail risk, ensuring system safety. When the safety margin deteriorates, it triggers switching the safety constraint from a performance-based relaxed-control barrier function (R-CBF) to a conservative conditional value at risk (CVaR-CBF) to address the safety concern. This switching is governed by two real-time triggers: Feasibility-Triggered (FT) and Quality-Triggered (QT) conditions. In the FT condition, if the R-CBF constraint becomes infeasible or yields a suboptimal solution, the risk monitor triggers the use of the CVaR constraints for the controller. In the QT condition, the risk monitor observes the safety margin of the R-CBF solution at every step, regardless of feasibility. If it falls below the safety margin, the safety filter switches to the CVaR-CBF constraints. The proposed framework is evaluated using a model predictive controller (MPC) for autonomous driving in the presence of autonomous vehicle (AV) localization noise and obstacle position uncertainties. Multiple AV-pedestrian interaction scenarios are considered, with 1,500 Monte Carlo runs conducted for all scenarios. In the most challenging setting with pedestrian detection uncertainty of 5 m, the proposed framework achieves a 94-96% success rate of not colliding with the pedestrians over 300 trials while maintaining the lowest mean cross-track error (CTE = 3.2-3.6 m) to the reference path. The reduced CTE indicates faster trajectory recovery after obstacle avoidance, demonstrating a balance between safety and performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2 features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .</p></details> |  |

However, the noisy and sparse nature of the returned scan data proves to be a challenging obstacle for existing registration algorithms, especially those originally intended for more accurate sensors such as LiDAR. Following the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting for vision, in this paper we propose a summarized representation for radar scenes based on global simultaneous optimization of 3D Gaussians as opposed to voxel-based approaches, and leveraging its inherent probability distribution function for registration. Moreover, we propose tackling the problem of radar noise by optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, following existing practice we implement an Extended Kalman Filter-based Radar-Inertial Odometry pipeline in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. Experiments using publicly available 4D radar datasets show that our Gaussian approach is comparable to existing registration algorithms, outperforming them in several sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and results can be publicly accessed at: https://github.com/robotics-upo/gaussian-rio-cpp</p></details> |

On the contrary, much fewer algorithms are available for optimal control of partially observed processes. However, this scenario is central to the digital twin paradigm where a physical twin is partially observed and control laws are derived based on a digital twin. In this paper, we contribute to this challenge by combining data assimilation in the form of the ensemble Kalman filter with the recently proposed McKean-Pontryagin approach to stochastic optimal control. We derive forward evolving mean-field evolution equations for states and co-states which simultaneously allow for an online assimilation of data as well as an online computation of control laws. The proposed methodology is therefore perfectly suited for real time applications of digital twins. We present numerical results for a controlled Lorenz-63 system and an inverted pendulum.</p></details> |  |

This is especially the case for problems governed by partial differential equations, where the repeated evaluation of the forward operator is extremely expensive. Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL)-based surrogate models have shown promising potential to accelerate the solution of such problems. However, despite their ability to learn from complex data, DL-based surrogate models generally cannot match the accuracy of high-fidelity numerical models, which limits their practical applicability. We propose a novel hybrid two-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that combines the strengths of DL-based surrogate models and high-fidelity numerical solvers to {compute the posterior mean of Quantities of Interest (QoI) in} Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. The intuition is to leverage the evaluation speed of a DL-based surrogate model as the base chain, and correct its errors using a limited number of high-fidelity numerical model evaluations in a correction chain; hence its name hybrid two-level MCMC method. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we show that our approach can achieve the same accuracy as a pure numerical MCMC method while requiring only a small fraction of the computational cost. The theoretical analysis is further supported by several numerical experiments, namely a Poisson, a non-linear reaction-diffusion, and a Navier-Stokes equation. The proposed hybrid framework can be generalized to other approaches such as the ensemble Kalman filter and sequential Monte Carlo methods.</p></details> |  |

A two-degree-of-freedom control structure can decouple nominal performance from disturbance rejection. However, perfect disturbance rejection is unattainable when the disturbance dynamic is unknown. In this work, we reveal an inherent trade-off in disturbance estimation subject to tracking speed and tracking uncertainty. Then, we propose two novel methods to enhance disturbance estimation: an interacting multiple model extended Kalman filter-based disturbance observer and a multi-kernel correntropy extended Kalman filter-based disturbance observer. Experiments on an exoskeleton verify that the proposed two methods improve the tracking accuracy $36.3\%$ and $16.2\%$ in hip joint error, and $46.3\%$ and $24.4\%$ in knee joint error, respectively, compared to the extended Kalman filter-based disturbance observer, in a time-varying interaction force scenario, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

To enable online learning for these systems, this paper formulates the system as Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) and develops a recursive learning method. The main contributions are threefold. First, a heterogeneous multi-output kernel is designed, allowing each output dimension to adopt distinct kernel types, hyperparameters, and input variables, improving expressiveness in multi-dimensional dynamics learning. Second, an inducing-point management algorithm enhances computational efficiency through independent selection and pruning for each output dimension. Third, a unified recursive inference framework for GPSSMs is derived, supporting general moment matching approaches, including the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and assumed density filtering (ADF), enabling accurate learning under strong nonlinearity and significant noise. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of SOTA offline GPSSMs with only 1/100 of the runtime, and surpasses SOTA online GPSSMs by around 70% in accuracy under heavy noise while using only 1/20 of the runtime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Ensemble-based Data Assimilation: A Machine Learning-Enhanced Data Assimilation Method with Limited Ensemble Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15284v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems. However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN). Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of alternative ensemble-based DA methods.</p></details> |  |

While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor fusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across public and longterm datasets.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer strong safety guarantees when accurate system and sensor models are available. However, widely used additive, fixed-noise models are not representative of complex sensor modalities with state-dependent error characteristics. Although CBFs have been designed to mitigate uncertainty using fixed worst-case bounds on measurement noise, this approach can lead to overly-conservative control. To solve this problem, we extend the Belief Control Barrier Function (BCBF) framework to accommodate state-dependent measurement noise via the Generalized Extended Kalman Filter (GEKF) algorithm, which models measurement noise as a linear function of the state. Using the original BCBF framework as baseline, we demonstrate the performance of the BCBF-GEKF approach through simulation results on a 1D single integrator setpoint tracking scenario and 2D unicycle kinematics trajectory tracking scenario. Our results confirm that the BCBF-GEKF approach offers less conservative control with greater safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - Submitted to the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |

By analyzing the distribution evolution along Bayes' rule, we reveal two essential properties that enhance the performance of Bayesian attitude filters with MFDs, particularly in challenging conditions from a theoretical viewpoint. Benefiting from the new understanding of the filtering mechanism associated with MFDs, two closed-form filters with MFDs are then proposed. The filters avoids the burdensome computations in previous MFD-based filters by introducing linearized error systems with invariant errors but retaining the two advantageous properties. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed filters are more accurate than the classic invariant Kalman filter. Besides, it is also as accurate as recent MFD-based Bayesian filters in challenging circumstances with large initial error and measurement uncertainty, but it consumes far less computation time (about 1/5 to 1/100 of previous MFD-based attitude filters).</p></details> |  |
| **[MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability. Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii) Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and (iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at https://github.com/Annzstbl/MMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State-Space Models for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08045v5)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model predictive control (MPC) has proven useful in enabling safe and optimal motion planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional GP frameworks predominantly operate under the assumption that the inputs are either accurately known or subject to zero-mean noise. However, several real-world applications such as mobile sensors have imperfect localization, leading to inputs with biased errors. These biases can typically be estimated through measurements collected over time using, for example, Kalman filters. To avoid recomputation of the entire GP model when better estimates of the inputs used in the training data become available, we introduce a technique for updating a trained GP model to incorporate updated estimates of the inputs. By leveraging the differentiability of the mean and covariance functions derived from the squared exponential kernel, a second-order correction algorithm is developed to update the trained GP models. Precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of kernels enable real-time refinement of the mean and covariance predictions. The efficacy of the developed approach is demonstrated using two simulation studies, with error analyses revealing improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Impro...</summary><p>Improving the paper with better results and adding experimental results to publish again</p></details> |

However, the cluttered nature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances, which can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation approach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is a lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable heading estimation. In the proposed approach, gyroscope angular rate measurements are integrated to propagate the quaternion state, which is subsequently corrected using accelerometer and magnetometer data. The corrected quaternion is then used to compute the UAV's heading. An adaptive process noise covariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope measurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler method integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances, a scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection. A theoretical observability analysis of the proposed AMO-HEAD is performed using the Lie derivative. Extensive experiments were conducted in real world indoor environments with customized UAV platforms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing precise heading estimation under magnetically disturbed conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observability and parameter estimation of a generic model for aggregated distributed energy resources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10892v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for estimating the parameters of an aggregated distributed energy resources (der_a) model. First, we introduce a rigorous method to determine whether all model parameters are estimable. When they are not, our approach identifies the subset of parameters that can be estimated. The proposed framework offers new insights into the number and specific parameters that can be reliably estimated based on commonly available measurements. It also highlights the limitations of calibrating such models. Second, we introduce a Kalman filtering method to calibrate the der_a model. Since we account for nonlinear effects such as saturation and deadbands, we develop a specific mechanism to handle smoothing functions within the Kalman filter. Specifically, we consider the extended and the unscented Kalman filter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a modified IEEE 34-node distribution feeder with inverter-based resources. Our findings align with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's parameterization guideline and underscore the importance of model calibration in accurately capturing the collective dynamics of distributed energy resources installed on distribution systems.</p></details> |  |

Designed specifically for fusing LiDAR odometry in multisensor systems, the proposed method ensures accurate pose estimation and consistent noise parameter inference, even in LiDAR-degraded environments. By approximating the posterior distribution using particles within the Stein Variational Inference framework, SVN-ICP eliminates the need for explicit noise modeling or manual parameter tuning. To evaluate its effectiveness, we integrate SVN-ICP into a simple error-state Kalman filter alongside an IMU and test it across multiple datasets spanning diverse environments and robot types. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms best-in-class methods on challenging scenarios while providing reliable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensing Management for Pilot-Free Predictive Beamforming in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06936v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a sensing management method for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Conventional communication systems employ channel estimation procedures that impose significant overhead during data transmission, consuming resources that could otherwise be utilized for data. To address this challenge, we propose a state-based approach that leverages sensing capabilities to track the user when there is no communication request. Upon receiving a communication request, predictive beamforming is employed based on the tracked user position, thereby reducing the need for channel estimation. Our framework incorporates an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based tracking algorithm with adaptive sensing management to perform sensing operations only when necessary to maintain high tracking accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing management approach provides uniform downlink communication rates that are higher than with existing methods by achieving overhead-free predictive beamforming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Martingale Posterior Neural Networks for Fast Sequential Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11898v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning of neural network parameters and Bayesian sequential decision making. Unlike classical Bayesian neural networks, which induce predictive uncertainty through a posterior over model parameters, our methods adopt a predictive-first perspective based on martingale posteriors. In particular, we work directly with the one-step-ahead posterior predictive, which we parameterize with a neural network and update sequentially with incoming observations. This decouples Bayesian decision-making from parameter-space inference: we sample from the posterior predictive for decision making, and update the parameters of the posterior predictive via fast, frequentist Kalman-filter-like recursions. Our algorithms operate in a fully online, replay-free setting, providing principled uncertainty quantification without costly posterior sampling. Empirically, they achieve competitive performance-speed trade-offs in non-stationary contextual bandits and Bayesian optimization, offering 10-100 times faster inference than classical Thompson sampling while maintaining comparable or superior decision performance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we develop a structurally informed DA framework using ensemble transform Kalman filtering (ETKF). Our approach introduces gradient-based weighting matrices constructed from finite difference statistics of the forecast ensemble, thereby allowing the assimilation process to dynamically adjust the influence of observations and prior estimates according to local roughness. The design is intentionally flexible so that it can be suitably refined for sparse data environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our new structurally informed data assimilation framework consistently yields greater accuracy when compared to more conventional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid calibration of atrial electrophysiology models using Gaussian process emulators in the ensemble Kalman filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06191v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia characterised by disordered electrical activity in the atria. The standard treatment is catheter ablation, which is invasive and irreversible. Recent advances in computational electrophysiology offer the potential for patient-specific models, often referred to as digital twins, that can be used to guide clinical decisions. To be of practical value, we must be able to rapidly calibrate physics-based models using routine clinical measurements. We pose this calibration task as a static inverse problem, where the goal is to infer tissue-level electrophysiological parameters from the available observations. To make this tractable, we replace the expensive forward model with Gaussian process emulators (GPEs), and propose a novel adaptation of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for static non-linear inverse problems. The approach yields parameter samples that can be interpreted as coming from the best Gaussian approximation of the posterior distribution. We compare our results with those obtained using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and demonstrate the potential of the approach to enable near-real-time patient-specific calibration, a key step towards predicting outcomes of AF treatment within clinical timescales. The approach is readily applicable to a wide range of static inverse problems in science and engineering.</p></details> |  |

While centralized sensor fusion has traditionally been used to improve pose estimation accuracy, this paper presents a novel decentralized fusion approach to estimate both pose and velocity. We use dual-view measurements from an eye-in-hand and an eye-to-hand vision sensor configuration mounted on a manipulator to track a target object whose motion is modeled as random walk (stochastic acceleration model). The robot runs two independent adaptive extended Kalman filters formulated on a matrix Lie group, developed as part of this work. These filters predict poses and velocities on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$ and update the state on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. The final fused state comprising the fused pose and velocities of the target is obtained using a correlation-aware fusion rule on Lie groups. The proposed method is evaluated on a UFactory xArm 850 equipped with Intel RealSense cameras, tracking a moving target. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed decentralized dual-view estimation framework, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Conventional sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle filters suffer from fundamental limitations, in scenarios involving degenerate likelihoods or high-dimensional states, due to the weight degeneracy issue. In this paper, we explore an alternative method, which is based on estimating the Brenier optimal transport (OT) map from the current prior distribution of the state to the posterior distribution at the next time step. Unlike SIR particle filters, the OT formulation does not require the analytical form of the likelihood. Moreover, it allows us to harness the approximation power of neural networks to model complex and multi-modal distributions and employ stochastic optimization algorithms to enhance scalability. Extensive numerical experiments are presented that compare the OT method to the SIR particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter, evaluating the performance in terms of sample efficiency, high-dimensional scalability, and the ability to capture complex and multi-modal distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 17 figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

Traditional methods such as Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and the Kalman Filter (KF) often struggle to track abrupt parameter shifts or incur high computational costs, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments and for computationally constrained robotic systems. As such, we introduce TAG-K, a lightweight extension of the Kaczmarz method that combines greedy randomized row selection for rapid convergence with tail averaging for robustness under noise and inconsistency. This design enables fast, stable parameter adaptation while retaining the low per-iteration complexity inherent to the Kaczmarz framework. We evaluate TAG-K in synthetic benchmarks and quadrotor tracking tasks against RLS, KF, and other Kaczmarz variants. TAG-K achieves 1.5x-1.9x faster solve times on laptop-class CPUs and 4.8x-20.7x faster solve times on embedded microcontrollers. More importantly, these speedups are paired with improved resilience to measurement noise and a 25% reduction in estimation error, leading to nearly 2x better end-to-end tracking performance.</p></details> |  |

The main difficulty lies in the sparsity of the motion data compared to the wide variation of the objects and environments as well as the poor availability of transition motions between different tasks, increasing the complexity of the generalization to arbitrary conditions. To cope with this issue, we develop a system that tackles the interaction synthesis problem as a hierarchical goal-driven task. Firstly, we develop a bimanual scheduler that plans a set of keyframes for simultaneously controlling the two hands to efficiently achieve the pick-and-place task from an abstract goal signal such as the target object selected by the user. Next, we develop a neural implicit planner that generates guidance hand trajectories under diverse object shape/types and obstacle layouts. Finally, we propose a linear dynamic model for our DeepPhase controller that incorporates a Kalman filter to enable smooth transitions in the frequency domain, resulting in a more realistic and effective multi-objective control of the character.Our system can produce a wide range of natural pick-and-place movements with respect to the geometry of objects, the articulation of containers and the layout of the objects in the scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transaction on Graphics 2025;21 pages, 15 figures; Webpage: https://lujintaozju.github.io/publications/CHOICE/</p></details> |
| **[Multiscale modelling of animal movement with persistent dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15195v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wild animals are commonly fitted with trackers that record their position through time, and statistical models for tracking data broadly fall into two categories: models focused on small-scale movement decisions, and models for large-scale spatial distributions. Due to this dichotomy, it is challenging to describe mathematically how animals' distributions arise from their short-term movement patterns, and to combine data sets collected at different scales. We propose a multiscale model of animal movement and space use based on the underdamped Langevin process, widely used in statistical physics. The model is convenient to describe animal movement for three reasons: it is specified in continuous time (such that its parameters are not dependent on an arbitrary time scale), its speed and direction are autocorrelated (similarly to real animal trajectories), and it has a closed form stationary distribution that we can view as a model of long-term space use. We use the common form of a resource selection function for the stationary distribution, to model the environmental drivers behind the animal's movement decisions. We further increase flexibility by allowing movement parameters to be time-varying, and find conditions under which the stationary distribution is preserved. We derive an explicit mathematical link to step selection functions, commonly used in wildlife studies, providing new theoretical results about their scale-dependence. We formulate the underdamped Langevin model as a state-space model and present a computationally efficient method of inference based on the Kalman filter and a marginal likelihood approach for mixed effect extensions.</p></details> |  |

FPSPs accelerate vision-based algorithms such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO). However, VIO frameworks suffer from spatial drift due to the vision-based pose estimation, whilst temporal drift arises from the inertial measurements. FPSPs circumvent the spatial drift by operating at a high frame rate to match the high-frequency output of the inertial measurements. In this paper, we present TCB-VIO, a tightly-coupled 6 degrees-of-freedom VIO by a Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF), operating at a high frame-rate of 250 FPS and from IMU measurements obtained at 400 Hz.

Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown that an invariant formulation of the extended Kalman filter improves the convergence and robustness of visual-inertial odometry by utilizing the Lie group structure of a robot's position, velocity, and orientation states. However, inertial sensors also require measurement bias estimation, yet introducing the bias in the filter state breaks the Lie group symmetry. In this paper, we design a neural network to predict the bias of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) from a sequence of previous IMU measurements. This allows us to use an invariant filter for visual inertial odometry, relying on the learned bias prediction rather than introducing the bias in the filter state. We demonstrate that an invariant multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) with learned bias predictions achieves robust visual-inertial odometry in real experiments, even when visual information is unavailable for extended periods and the system needs to rely solely on IMU measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The proposed algorithm integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in obstacle avoidance.

Many of the available visual SLAM methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, all while operating in near real-time.

Pipeline flow and pressure dynamics are modeled on a directed graph using nodal pressure evolution and edge-based Weymouth-type relations, including control-aware equipment such as valves and compressors. An extended Kalman filter estimates the full network state from partial SCADA telemetry. The controller computes pressure-safe control inputs via MPC under actuator constraints and forecasted demands. Adversarial manipulation is formalized as a bi-level optimization problem where an attacker perturbs sensor data to degrade throughput while remaining undetected by bad-data detectors. This attack-control interaction is solved via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation, which results in a tractable mixed-integer quadratic program. Test gas pipeline case studies demonstrate the covert reduction of service delivery under attack. Results show that undetectable attacks can cause sustained throughput loss with minimal instantaneous deviation. This reveals the need for integrated detection and control strategies in cyber-physical infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

Through a proof-of-concept hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning) performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across multiple gaits.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Control Theory inspired Exploration Method for a Linear Bandit driven by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01364v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper introduces a linear bandit environment where the reward is the output of a known Linear Gaussian Dynamical System (LGDS). In this environment, we address the fundamental challenge of balancing exploration -- gathering information about the environment -- and exploitation -- selecting to the action with the highest predicted reward. We propose two algorithms, Kalman filter Upper Confidence Bound (Kalman-UCB) and Information filter Directed Exploration Action-selection (IDEA). Kalman-UCB uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. IDEA selects actions that maximize the combination of the predicted reward and a term that quantifies how much an action minimizes the error of the Kalman filter state prediction, which depends on the LGDS property called observability. IDEA is motivated by applications such as hyperparameter optimization in machine learning. A major problem encountered in hyperparameter optimization is the large action spaces, which hinder the performance of methods inspired by principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty as they need to explore each action to lower reward prediction uncertainty. To predict if either Kalman-UCB or IDEA will perform better, a metric based on the LGDS properties is provided. This metric is validated with numerical results across a variety of randomly generated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Based Observer Design: A Framework for Lightweight Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00630v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Characterization of Ensemble Kalman Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00158v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The update in the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), called the Ensemble Kalman Update (EnKU), is widely used for Bayesian inference in inverse problems and data assimilation. At each filtering step, it approximates the solution to a likelihood-free Bayesian inversion from an ensemble of particles $(X_i,Y_i)\sim\pi$ sampled from a joint measure $\pi$ and an observation $y_\ast\in\mathbb{R}^m$. The posterior ${\pi}_{X|Y=y_\ast}$ is approximated by transporting $(X_i,Y_i)$ through an affine map $L^{\mathrm{EnKU}}_{y_\ast}(x,y)$ determined by the Kalman gain. While the EnKU is exact for Gaussian joints $\pi$ in the mean-field limit, exactness alone does not fix the update: infinitely many affine maps $L_{y_\ast}$ push a Gaussian $\pi$ to $\pi_{X|Y=y_\ast}$. This raises a question: which affine map should estimate the posterior? We provide a characterization of the EnKU among all such maps. First, we describe the set $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{EnKU}}$ of laws where the EnKU yields exact conditioning, showing it is larger than the Gaussian family. Next, we prove that, except for a small class of highly symmetric distributions in $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{EnKU}}$ (including Gaussians), the EnKU is the unique exact affine conditioning map. Finally, we ask for the largest possible set $\mathrm{F}$ where any measure-dependent affine transport could be exact; after characterizing $\mathrm{F}$, we show the EnKU's exactness set is almost maximal: $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{EnKU}}\cup\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{nl-dec}}$, where $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{nl-dec}}$ is a small symmetry class. Thus, among affine transports, the EnKU is near-optimal for exact conditioning beyond Gaussians and is the unique affine update achieving exactness for any measure in $\mathrm{F}$ except a subclass of strongly symmetric laws.</p></details> | 29 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Data-Efficient Multitask DAgger](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25466v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real robot without using real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infrastructure Sensor-enabled Vehicle Data Generation using Multi-Sensor Fusion for Proactive Safety Applications at Work Zone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25452v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry, occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth, demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Net: Transferable Queue Length Estimation via Kalman-based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24725v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated. Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i) vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments. Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays. Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar. Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, the localization scenarios and the problem model are analyzed. An integrated architecture of Attention Mechanism-based Fusion Algorithm (AMFA) incorporating planar array Ultra-Wideband (UWB), GPS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and barometer is designed to handle challenges such as GPS occlusion and UWB Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem. Then, End-to-end neural network inference models for UWB and barometer are developed, along with a multimodal attention mechanism for adaptive data fusion. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied to refine the trajectory, improving accuracy and robustness. Finally, real-world experiments show that the method achieves 0.48 m localization accuracy and lower MAX error of 1.50 m, outperforming baseline algorithms such as GPS/INS-EKF and demonstrating stronger robustness.</p></details> |  |

Magnetometers employed as sensors for such attitude determination are easily prone to disturbances by their sensitivity to calibration and external magnetic fields. The TRIAD (Tri-Axial Attitude Determination) algorithm is well known as a sub-optimal attitude estimator. In this article, we incorporate this sub-optimal feature of the TRIAD in mitigating the influence of the magnetometer reading in the pitch and roll axis determination in the Manifold EKF algorithm. We substantiate our results with experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimality of Linear Policies in Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11858v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a generalization of the classical discrete-time, Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem where the noise distributions affecting the states and observations are unknown and chosen adversarially from divergence-based ambiguity sets centered around a known nominal distribution. For a finite horizon model with Gaussian nominal noise and a structural assumption on the divergence that is satisfied by many examples -- including 2-Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, moment-based divergences, entropy-regularized optimal transport, or Fisher (score-matching) divergence -- we prove that a control policy that is affine in the observations is optimal and the adversary's corresponding worst-case optimal distribution is Gaussian. When the nominal means are zero (as in the classical LQG model), we show that the adversary should optimally set the distribution's mean to zero and the optimal control policy becomes linear. Moreover, the adversary should optimally ``inflate" the noise by choosing covariance matrices that dominate the nominal covariance in Loewner order. Exploiting these structural properties, we develop a Frank-Wolfe algorithm whose inner step solves standard LQG subproblems via Kalman filtering and dynamic programming and show that the implementation consistently outperforms semidefinite-programming reformulations of the problem. All structural and algorithmic results extend to an infinite-horizon, average-cost formulation, yielding stationary linear policies and a time-invariant Gaussian distribution for the adversary. Lastly, we show that when the divergence is 2-Wasserstein, the entire framework remains valid when the nominal distributions are elliptical rather than Gaussian.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching for Efficient and Scalable Data Assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13313v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data assimilation (DA) estimates a dynamical system's state from noisy observations. Recent generative models like the ensemble score filter (EnSF) improve DA in high-dimensional nonlinear settings but are computationally expensive. We introduce the ensemble flow filter (EnFF), a training-free, flow matching (FM)-based framework that accelerates sampling and offers flexibility in flow design. EnFF uses Monte Carlo estimators for the marginal flow field, localized guidance for observation assimilation, and utilizes a novel flow that exploits the Bayesian DA formulation. It generalizes classical filters such as the bootstrap particle filter and ensemble Kalman filter. Experiments on high-dimensional benchmarks demonstrate EnFF's improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs and scalability, highlighting FM's potential for efficient, scalable DA.

| **[EKF-Based Fusion of Wi-Fi/LiDAR/IMU for Indoor Localization and Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23118v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting cannot meet the growing demand for accurate indoor localization and navigation due to its lower accuracy, while solutions based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can provide better localization performance but is limited by their higher deployment cost and complexity. To address these issues, we propose a novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, and submitted for presentation at a conference</p></details> |
| **[Model Training, Data Assimilation, and Forecast Experiments with a Hybrid Atmospheric Model that Incorporates Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22465v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hybrid model combines the physics-based primitive-equations model SPEEDY with a machine learning-based (ML-based) model component, while ERA5 reanalyses provide the presumed true states of the atmosphere. Six-hourly simulated noisy observations are generated for a 30-year ML training period and a one-year testing period. These observations are assimilated with a Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), and a 10-day deterministic forecast is also started from each ensemble mean analysis of the testing period. In the first experiment, the physics-based model provides the background ensemble members and the 10-day deterministic forecasts. In the other three experiments, the hybrid model plays the same role as the physics-based model in the first experiment, but it is trained on a different data set in each experiment. These training data sets are analyses obtained by using the physics-based model (second experiment), the hybrid model of the previous experiment (third experiment), and for comparison, ERA5 reanalyses (fourth experiment). The results of the experiments show that hybridizing the model can substantially improve the accuracy of the analyses and forecasts. When the model is trained on ERA5 reanalyses, the biases of the analyses are negligible and the magnitude of the flow-dependent part of the analysis errors is greatly reduced. While the gains in analysis accuracy are distinctly more modest in the other two hybrid model experiments, the gains in forecast accuracy tend to be larger in those experiments after 1-3 forecast days. However, these extra gains of forecast accuracy are achieved, in part, by a modest gradual reduction of the spatial variability of the forecasts.</p></details> |  |

The convergence of these domains has enabled significant advances in CV-QKD performance, particularly in phase synchronization, polarization tracking, and excess noise mitigation. To provide a comprehensive and reproducible synthesis of this emerging field, we employed the APISSER methodology, a task-oriented framework adapted from the PRISMA protocol. A structured search across IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases (2021-2025) yielded 220 relevant publications, which were screened, classified, and analyzed to address six research questions. Our findings highlight that many classical DSP algorithms, such as Kalman filtering, carrier recovery, adaptive equalization, and machine-learning-assisted signal estimation, have been successfully adapted to the quantum regime, often requiring modifications to meet security and noise constraints. We also identify a range of recent DSP innovations in coherent optical communication systems with high potential for future CV-QKD integration, including neural equalization, probabilistic shaping, and joint retiming-equalization filters. Despite these advances, challenges remain in achieving robust phase tracking under ultra-low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, real-time polarization compensation, and secure co-existence with classical channels. This review maps current trends, technical barriers, and emerging opportunities at the intersection of signal processing for quantum and classical communication, supporting the development of scalable and resilient CV-QKD systems.</p></details> |  |

Urban deployments demand scalable, real-time tracking solutions, yet traditional remote sensing remains costly and computationally intensive, especially under perceptually degraded conditions. Our sensor node couples a single lidar with an edge computing unit and runs a computationally efficient, GPU-free observer that simultaneously estimates object state, class, dimensions, and existence probability. The pipeline performs: (i) state updates via an extended Kalman filter, (ii) dimension estimation using a 1D grid-map/Bayesian update, (iii) class updates via a lookup table driven by the most probable footprint, and (iv) existence estimation from track age and bounding-box consistency. Experiments in dynamic urban-like scenes with diverse traffic participants demonstrate real-time performance and high precision: The complete end-to-end pipeline finishes within \SI{100}{\milli\second} for \SI{99.88}{\%} of messages, with an excellent detection rate. Robustness is further confirmed under simulated wind and sensor vibration. These results indicate that reliable, real-time roadside tracking is feasible on CPU-only edge hardware, enabling scalable, privacy-friendly deployments within existing city infrastructure. The framework integrates with existing poles, traffic lights, and buildings, reducing deployment costs and simplifying large-scale urban rollouts and maintenance efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, this work was submitted to Wileys'Advanced Intelligent Systems for review</p></details> |

The model provides a simplified framework that neglects actuator dynamics and aerodynamic effects while capturing the complexities of underactuation and state coupling. Trajectory tracking is achieved through a modularized and layered control architecture, with employement of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Lyapunov theory. Full-state estimation is achieved through Kalman filtering techniques, part of the navigation module. The solutions are thoroughly evaluated in a custom-built MATLAB/Simulink testbed, simulating real-world conditions while maintaining a simplified setup. The results reveal limitations along the lateral axis, whose resolution is suggested for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kalman Filter Enhanced GRPO for Reinforcement Learning-Based Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07527v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advantage function is a central concept in RL that helps reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. Recently, for language modeling, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was proposed to compute the advantage for each output by subtracting the mean reward, as the baseline, for all outputs in the group. However, it can lead to high variance when the reward advantage is inaccurately predicted. In this work, we propose Kalman Filter Enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization (KRPO) model, by using lightweight Kalman filtering to dynamically estimate the latent reward baseline and uncertainty. This filtering technique replaces the naive group mean, enabling more adaptive advantage normalization. Our method does not require additional learned parameters over GRPO. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate multiple outputs of GRPO into advantage estimation, improving policy optimization in settings where highly dynamic reward signals are difficult to model for language models. Through the accuracies and rewards obtained from math question answering and reasoning, we show that using a more adaptive advantage estimation model, KRPO can improve the stability and performance of GRPO. The code is available at https://github.com/billhhh/KRPO_LLMs_RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[A direct approach for full-field state-parameter estimation from fusion of noncollocated multi-rate sensor data using UKF-based algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19511v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous sensor setups may entail measurements recorded at varying sampling frequencies, commonly known as multi-rate data. For system identification and state estimation with such data, existing studies mostly focus on data fusion algorithms that utilize acceleration measurements, with collocated measurements of other types at lower sampling frequencies, to estimate the displacement at the collocated location with the sampling frequency of the acceleration measurements. The obtained displacements, along with the available acceleration measurements, are then utilized for system identification. This paper introduces a direct and straightforward methodology aimed at estimating the states (i.e., displacements and velocities) along with the unknown structural parameters from fused multi-rate data through Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based algorithms with a modification during measurement update. By utilizing all available measurements at any time instant, which can differ due to the multi-rate nature, and by modifying the non-linear measurement equation of the system accordingly at the considered time instant, the UKF framework is suitably tailored for direct applications with multi-rate measurements. The approach is demonstrated with a variety of numerical and laboratory-scale experiments, including fusion of higher sampling frequency acceleration data with lower sampling frequency displacement, axial strain, or bending strain data. The results show that the approach is successful in accurately estimating full-field states and parameters. The state estimates compare well with those obtained using existing data fusion algorithms. The advantages of the approach lie in not requiring collocated sensing, in its generalizability for different types of measurements, in its simplicity and ease of implementation, and in achieving both the state and parameter estimates simultaneously.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Regularity estimate and sparse approximation of pathwise robust Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19093v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we establish an \textit{a priori} estimate for arbitrary-order derivatives of the solution to the pathwise robust Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai (DMZ) equation within the framework of weighted Sobolev spaces. The weight function, which vanishes on the physical boundary, is crucial for the \textit{a priori} estimate, but introduces a loss of regularity near the boundary. Therefore, we employ the Sobolev inequalities and their weighted analogues to sharpen the regularity bound, providing improvements in both classical Sobolev spaces and H{\"o}lder continuity estimates. The refined regularity estimate reinforces the plausibility of the quantized tensor train (QTT) method in [S. Li, Z. Wang, S. S.-T. Yau, and Z. Zhang, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 68 (2023), pp. 4405--4412] and provides convergence guarantees of the method. To further enhance the capacity of the method to solve the nonlinear filtering problem in a real-time manner, we reduce the complexity of the method under the assumption of a functional polyadic state drift $f$ and observation $h$. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to reaffirm our theory. For high-dimensional cubic sensor problems, our method demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy in comparison to the particle filter (PF) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Beyond this, for multi-mode problems, while the PF exhibits a lack of precision due to its stochastic nature and the EKF is constrained by its Gaussian assumption, the enhanced method provides an accurate reconstruction of the multi-mode conditional density function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust LiDAR Localization: Deep Learning-based Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18954v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based localization and SLAM often rely on iterative matching algorithms, particularly the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, to align sensor data with pre-existing maps or previous scans. However, ICP is prone to errors in featureless environments and dynamic scenes, leading to inaccurate pose estimation. Accurately predicting the uncertainty associated with ICP is crucial for robust state estimation but remains challenging, as existing approaches often rely on handcrafted models or simplified assumptions. Moreover, a few deep learning-based methods for localizability estimation either depend on a pre-built map, which may not always be available, or provide a binary classification of localizable versus non-localizable, which fails to properly model uncertainty. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that leverages deep learning to estimate the registration error covariance of ICP before matching, even in the absence of a reference map. By associating each LiDAR scan with a reliable 6-DoF error covariance estimate, our method enables seamless integration of ICP within Kalman filtering, enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it accurately predicts covariance and, when applied to localization using a pre-built map or SLAM, reduces localization errors and improves robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Particle Filtering for Non-Deterministic Electrocardiographic Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19404v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) aims to non-invasively reconstruct activation maps of the heart from temporal body surface potentials. While most existing approaches rely on inverse and optimization techniques that may yield satisfactory reconstructions, they typically provide a single deterministic solution, overlooking the inherent uncertainty of the problem stemming from its very ill-posed nature, the poor knowledge of biophysical features and the unavoidable presence of noise in the measurements. The Bayesian framework, which naturally incorporates uncertainty while also accounting for temporal correlations across time steps, can be used to address this limitation. In this work, we propose a low-dimensional representation of the activation sequence that enables the use of particle filtering, a Bayesian filtering method that does not rely on predefined assumptions regarding the shape of the posterior distribution, in contrast to approaches like the Kalman filter. This allows to produce not only activation maps but also probabilistic maps indicating the likelihood of activation at each point on the heart over time, as well as pseudo-probability maps reflecting the likelihood of a point being part of an earliest activation site. Additionally, we introduce a method to estimate the probability of the presence of a conduction lines of block on the heart surface. Combined with classical reconstruction techniques, this could help discriminate artificial from true lines of block in activation maps. We support our approach with a numerical study based on simulated data, demonstrating the potential of our method.</p></details> |  |

We develop an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for real-time state estimation, with the measurement noise modeled as an infinite-dimensional random field. When applied to vision-based state estimation, the measurement Jacobians required to implement the EKF are shown to correspond to image gradients. This result provides a novel system-theoretic justification for the use of image gradients as features for vision-based state estimation, contrasting with their (often heuristic) introduction in many computer-vision pipelines. We demonstrate the practical utility of the EKF on a public real-world dataset involving the localization of an aerial drone using video from a downward-facing monocular camera. The EKF is shown to outperform VINS-MONO, an established visual-inertial odometry algorithm, in some cases achieving mean squared error reductions of up to an order of magnitude.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[DANSE: Data-driven Non-linear State Estimation of Model-free Process in Unsupervised Learning Setup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03897v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. For a model-free process, we do not have any a-priori knowledge of the process dynamics. In the article, we propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not have access to state information in the training data and can not use supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models (Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), a data-driven deep Markov model (DMM) and a recently proposed hybrid method called KalmanNet. In addition, we show that DANSE works for high-dimensional state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions in Signal Processing.

| **[An Analysis of Kalman Filter based Object Tracking Methods for Fast-Moving Tiny Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18451v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reversible Kalman Filter for state estimation with Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18224v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its primary objective is to provide a methodology enabling the evaluation of the precision of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary accuracy on synthetic data, something that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed in prior work. To this end, we develop a new filter that exhibits favorable numerical properties, thereby correcting the divergences observed in previous Kalman filter variants. In this formulation, the achievable precision is no longer constrained by the small-velocity assumption and is determined solely by sensor noise. In addition, this new filter assumes high precision on the sensors, which, in real scenarios require a detection step that we define heuristically, allowing one to extend this approach to scenarios, using either a 9-axis IMU or a combination of odometry, accelerometer, and pressure sensors. The latter configuration is designed for the reconstruction of trajectories in underwater environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stabilising Lifetime PD Models under Forecast Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10586v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating lifetime probabilities of default (PDs) under IFRS~9 and CECL requires projecting point--in--time transition matrices over multiple years. A persistent weakness is that macroeconomic forecast errors compound across horizons, producing unstable and volatile PD term structures. This paper reformulates the problem in a state--space framework and shows that a direct Kalman filter leaves non--vanishing variability. We then introduce an anchored observation model, which incorporates a neutral long--run economic state into the filter. The resulting error dynamics exhibit asymptotic stochastic stability, ensuring convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure. Simulation on a synthetic corporate portfolio confirms that anchoring reduces forecast noise and delivers smoother, more interpretable projections.</p></details> |  |

While monostatic ISAC has been well studied, its limited spatial diversity reduces reliability in high-mobility scenarios. Distributed ISAC alleviates this via cooperative nodes, but conventional OFDM-based designs remain vulnerable to Doppler shifts and multipath fading. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a resilient alternative, as its delay-Doppler domain representation enables robust communication and high-resolution sensing. Motivated by this, we extend OTFS to distributed ISAC and address the underexplored problem of spatial node deployment. We propose a triangulation-based framework that leverages spatial diversity to improve target localization, velocity estimation, and communication rates, and analytically characterize the role of deployment geometry in minimizing estimation error. Furthermore, we integrate Kalman filtering (KF) into distributed OTFS-ISAC to enhance tracking of moving targets, and design novel algorithms for active sensing, passive sensing, and joint sensing-communication. Closed-form expressions are derived for localization error under general topologies, and a near-optimal deployment strategy is identified by aligning receivers along orthogonal axes. Numerical evaluations show significant reductions in localization error and bit error rate (BER), while capturing the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and communication reliability. These results highlight the potential of KF-assisted node placement in distributed OTFS-ISAC for reliable, high-performance operation in dynamic wireless environments.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive approach to mobile robot localization by integrating an ultrasound-based indoor positioning system (IPS) with wheel odometry data via sensor fusion techniques. The fusion methodology leverages the strengths of both IPS and wheel odometry, compensating for the individual limitations of each method. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) fusion method combines the data from the IPS sensors and the robot's wheel odometry, providing a robust and reliable localization solution. Extensive experiments in a controlled indoor environment reveal that the fusion-based localization system significantly enhances accuracy and precision compared to standalone systems. The results demonstrate significant improvements in trajectory tracking, with the EKF-based approach reducing errors associated with wheel slippage and sensor noise.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures, |

Effective thermal management is essential to ensure part quality and structural integrity, as thermal gradients and residual stresses can lead to defects such as warping and cracking. However, existing experimental or computational techniques lack the ability to forecast future temperature distributions in real time, an essential capability for proactive process control. This paper presents a real-time thermal state forecasting framework for L-PBF, based on a physics-informed reduced-order thermal model integrated with a Kalman filtering scheme. The proposed approach efficiently captures inter-layer heat transfer dynamics and enables accurate tracking and forecasting of spatial and temporal temperature evolution. Validation across multiple part geometries using measured data demonstrates that the method reliably estimates and forecasts peak temperatures and cooling trends. By enabling predictive thermal control, this framework offers a practical and computationally efficient solution for thermal management in L-PBF, paving the way toward closed-loop control in L-PBF.</p></details> |  |

However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy. The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory prediction in V2X scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 pages, IROS2025</p></details> |

Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs face critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room layers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies non-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while over-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex environments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that rely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of traversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle segmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework that integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By leveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the proposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically coherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based scene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced segmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the proposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD) leading to higher pose estimation accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scene graph consistency and pose graph optimization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, VPR systems face significant challenges when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty (SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel UWB Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging for Mobile Robot Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02874v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 15th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) 2025, see https://ipin-conference.org/2025/</p></details> |

The proposed framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. The framework supports real-time, decentralized operation onboard the robots and has been integrated with three types of aerial and ground platforms. We validate its effectiveness through experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as benchmarks on public datasets and comparisons with existing methods. The framework is open-sourced and suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot real-time metric-semantic SLAM applications.

Inspired by this mental process, we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration. Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/JiahaoPlus/EvoWorld</p></details> |
| **[ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify its robustness and efficiency.

Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions, leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space. Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

This framework improves upon the original DRACo-SLAM by introducing a novel representation of sonar maps as object graphs and utilizing object graph matching to achieve time-efficient inter-robot loop closure detection without relying on prior geometric information. To better-accommodate the needs and characteristics of underwater scan matching, we propose incremental Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set Maximization (GCM), a modification of Pairwise Consistent Measurement Set Maximization (PCM), which effectively handles scenarios where nearby inter-robot loop closures share similar registration errors. The proposed approach is validated through extensive comparative analyses on simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-Mapper: Unified Mapping Framework for Multi-modal LiDARs in Complex and Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20538v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unification of disparate maps is crucial for enabling scalable robot operation across multiple sessions and collaborative multi-robot scenarios. However, achieving a unified map robust to sensor modalities and dynamic environments remains a challenging problem. Variations in LiDAR types and dynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene consistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure detection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges, this paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging framework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal, dynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A voxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify and reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal module is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved static local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic environments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are conducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a centralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during map merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph optimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for globally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse real-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing superior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping in dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing methods.

In this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors, LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions.

By normalizing point density, we project LiDAR point clouds into BEV images, thereby enabling efficient feature extraction and matching. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractor is employed to extract distinctive local and global descriptors from the BEV images. Local descriptors are used to match BEV images with FAST keypoints for reprojection error construction, while global descriptors facilitate loop closure detection. Reprojection error minimization is then integrated with point-to-plane registration within an iterated Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF). In the back-end, global descriptors are used to create a KD-tree-indexed keyframe database for accurate loop closure detection. When a loop closure is detected, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) computes a coarse transform from BEV image matching, which serves as the initial estimate for Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The refined transform is subsequently incorporated into a factor graph along with odometry factors, improving the global consistency of localization. Extensive experiments conducted in various scenarios with different LiDAR types demonstrate that BEV-LIO(LC) outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving competitive localization accuracy.

To address this, we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000 frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy. Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m, achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation.

A central challenge in these systems is aligning independently collected perception data across space and time, i.e., multi-robot data association. While recent advances in collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), map merging, and inter-robot loop closure detection have significantly progressed the field, evaluation strategies still predominantly rely on splitting a single trajectory from single-robot SLAM datasets into multiple segments to simulate multiple robots. Without careful consideration to how a single trajectory is split, this approach will fail to capture realistic pose-dependent variation in observations of a scene inherent to multi-robot systems. To address this gap, we present CU-Multi, a multi-robot dataset collected over multiple days at two locations on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Using a single robotic platform, we generate four synchronized runs with aligned start times and deliberate percentages of trajectory overlap. CU-Multi includes RGB-D, GPS with accurate geospatial heading, and semantically annotated LiDAR data.

It uses lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on Bird's Eye View (BEV) image-like representations of LiDAR data to achieve accurate global localization through place recognition, followed by 3-DoF pose estimation. Our detailed analyses reveal an interesting fact that CNNs are inherently effective at extracting distinctive features from LiDAR BEV images. Remarkably, keypoints of two BEV images with large translations can be effectively matched using CNN-extracted features. Building on this insight, we design a Rotation Equivariant Module (REM) to obtain distinctive features while enhancing robustness to rotational changes. A Rotation Equivariant and Invariant Network (REIN) is then developed by cascading REM and a descriptor generator, NetVLAD, to sequentially generate rotation equivariant local features and rotation invariant global descriptors. The global descriptors are used first to achieve robust place recognition, and then local features are used for accurate pose estimation. \revise{Experimental results on seven public datasets and our UGV platform demonstrate that BEVPlace++, even when trained on a small dataset (3000 frames of KITTI) only with place labels, generalizes well to unseen environments, performs consistently across different days and years, and adapts to various types of LiDAR scanners.} BEVPlace++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple tasks, including place recognition, loop closure detection, and global localization.

However, achieving real-time performance remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile robots and multi-robot systems due to the computational burden of high-density sampling, which increases the complexity of comparing and verifying query samples against a growing map database. Conventional methods often retain redundant information or miss critical data by relying on fixed sampling intervals or operating in 3-D space instead of the descriptor feature space. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of sample space and propose a novel keyframe sampling approach for LiDAR-based place recognition. Our method minimizes redundancy while preserving essential information in the hyper-dimensional descriptor space, supporting both learning-based and handcrafted descriptors. The proposed approach incorporates a sliding window optimization strategy to ensure efficient keyframe selection and real-time performance, enabling seamless integration into robotic pipelines.

In robotics, VPR is also referred to as Loop Closure Detection, which emphasizes spatial-temporal verification within a sequence. However, designing local features specifically for VPR is impractical, and relying on motion sequences imposes limitations. Inspired by these observations, we propose a novel, simple re-ranking method that refines global features through a Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approach under embodied constraints. First, we analyze the practical feasibility of embodied constraints in VPR and categorize them according to existing datasets, which include GPS tags, sequential timestamps, local feature matching, and self-similarity matrices. We then propose a learning-based MoF weight-computation approach, utilizing a multi-metric loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public datasets with minimal additional computational overhead. For instance, with only 25 KB of additional parameters and a processing time of 10 microseconds per frame, our method achieves a 0.9\% improvement over a DINOv2-based baseline performance on the Pitts-30k test set.</p></details> | 17 Pages |
| **[Visual Loop Closure Detection Through Deep Graph Consensus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21754v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual loop closure detection traditionally relies on place recognition methods to retrieve candidate loops that are validated using computationally expensive RANSAC-based geometric verification. As false positive loop closures significantly degrade downstream pose graph estimates, verifying a large number of candidates in online simultaneous localization and mapping scenarios is constrained by limited time and compute resources. While most deep loop closure detection approaches only operate on pairs of keyframes, we relax this constraint by considering neighborhoods of multiple keyframes when detecting loops. In this work, we introduce LoopGNN, a graph neural network architecture that estimates loop closure consensus by leveraging cliques of visually similar keyframes retrieved through place recognition. By propagating deep feature encodings among nodes of the clique, our method yields high-precision estimates while maintaining high recall. Extensive experimental evaluations on the TartanDrive 2.0 and NCLT datasets demonstrate that LoopGNN outperforms traditional baselines. Additionally, an ablation study across various keypoint extractors demonstrates that our method is robust, regardless of the type of deep feature encodings used, and exhibits higher computational efficiency compared to classical geometric verification baselines. We release our code, supplementary material, and keyframe data at https://loopgnn.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

We present a significantly improved bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization, achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages an approximate $k$-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately improve their results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Crucially, it integrates graph similarity scores into a probabilistic temporal filtering framework (modeled as an HMM/Bayes filter), incorporating uncertain odometry for motion modeling and utilizing forward-backward smoothing to effectively handle ambiguities. Evaluations on challenging KITTI sequences (00 and 08) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Average Precision of 96.2\% and 95.1\%, respectively. PNE-SGAN significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in difficult bidirectional loop scenarios where others falter. By synergizing detailed NDT geometry with principled probabilistic temporal reasoning, PNE-SGAN offers a highly accurate and robust solution for LiDAR LCD, enhancing SLAM reliability in complex, large-scale environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>We di...</summary><p>We discovered a critical implementation bug in Section 4 (probabilistic NDT-based semantic graph attention module) that invalidates the results shown in Figures 3-4</p></details> |

However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems usually struggle with large scene representation and lack effective loop closure detection. To address these issues, we introduce NGM-SLAM, the first 3DGS based SLAM system that utilizes neural radiance field submaps for progressive scene expression, effectively integrating the strengths of neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. We utilize neural radiance field submaps as supervision and achieve high-quality scene expression and online loop closure adjustments through Gaussian rendering of fused submaps. Our results on multiple real-world scenes and large-scale scene datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate hole filling and high-quality scene expression, supporting monocular, stereo, and RGB-D inputs, and achieving state-of-the-art scene reconstruction and tracking performance.</p></details> | 9pages, 4 figures |

Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details> |  |

It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures.

| **[ForestLPR: LiDAR Place Recognition in Forests Attentioning Multiple BEV Density Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04475v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is essential to maintain global consistency in large-scale localization systems. While research in urban environments has progressed significantly using LiDARs or cameras, applications in natural forest-like environments remain largely under-explored. Furthermore, forests present particular challenges due to high self-similarity and substantial variations in vegetation growth over time. In this work, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for natural forests, ForestLPR. We hypothesize that a set of cross-sectional images of the forest's geometry at different heights contains the information needed to recognize revisiting a place. The cross-sectional images are represented by \ac{bev} density images of horizontal slices of the point cloud at different heights. Our approach utilizes a visual transformer as the shared backbone to produce sets of local descriptors and introduces a multi-BEV interaction module to attend to information at different heights adaptively. It is followed by an aggregation layer that produces a rotation-invariant place descriptor. We evaluated the efficacy of our method extensively on real-world data from public benchmarks as well as robotic datasets and compared it against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results indicate that ForestLPR has consistently good performance on all evaluations and achieves an average increase of 7.38\% and 9.11\% on Recall@1 over the closest competitor on intra-sequence loop closure detection and inter-sequence re-localization, respectively, validating our hypothesis</p></details> | accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Large-Scale UWB Anchor Calibration and One-Shot Localization Using Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16880v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-wideband (UWB) is gaining popularity with devices like AirTags for precise home item localization but faces significant challenges when scaled to large environments like seaports. The main challenges are calibration and localization in obstructed conditions, which are common in logistics environments. Traditional calibration methods, dependent on line-of-sight (LoS), are slow, costly, and unreliable in seaports and warehouses, making large-scale localization a significant pain point in the industry. To overcome these challenges, we propose a UWB-LiDAR fusion-based calibration and one-shot localization framework. Our method uses Gaussian Processes to estimate anchor position from continuous-time LiDAR Inertial Odometry with sampled UWB ranges. This approach ensures accurate and reliable calibration with just one round of sampling in large-scale areas, I.e., 600x450 square meter. With the LoS issues, UWB-only localization can be problematic, even when anchor positions are known. We demonstrate that by applying a UWB-range filter, the search range for LiDAR loop closure descriptors is significantly reduced, improving both accuracy and speed. This concept can be applied to other loop closure detection methods, enabling cost-effective localization in large-scale warehouses and seaports. It significantly improves precision in challenging environments where UWB-only and LiDAR-Inertial methods fall short, as shown in the video (https://youtu.be/oY8jQKdM7lU). We will open-source our datasets and calibration codes for community use.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) @ 2025 IEEE.

| **[Introspective Loop Closure for SLAM with 4D Imaging Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02383v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) allows mobile robots to navigate without external positioning systems or pre-existing maps. Radar is emerging as a valuable sensing tool, especially in vision-obstructed environments, as it is less affected by particles than lidars or cameras. Modern 4D imaging radars provide three-dimensional geometric information and relative velocity measurements, but they bring challenges, such as a small field of view and sparse, noisy point clouds. Detecting loop closures in SLAM is critical for reducing trajectory drift and maintaining map accuracy. However, the directional nature of 4D radar data makes identifying loop closures, especially from reverse viewpoints, difficult due to limited scan overlap. This article explores using 4D radar for loop closure in SLAM, focusing on similar and opposing viewpoints. We generate submaps for a denser environment representation and use introspective measures to reject false detections in feature-degenerate environments. Our experiments show accurate loop closure detection in geometrically diverse settings for both similar and opposing viewpoints, improving trajectory estimation with up to 82 % improvement in ATE and rejecting false positives in self-similar environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. In sum, evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables.

However, thermal imaging faces challenges like low contrast, high noise, and limited large-scale annotated datasets, restricting the use of deep learning in outdoor scenarios. We present DarkSLAM, a noval deep learning-based monocular thermal SLAM system designed for large-scale localization and reconstruction in complex lighting conditions.Our approach incorporates the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism in visual odometry and the Selective Kernel Attention (SKA) mechanism in depth estimation to enhance pose accuracy and mitigate thermal depth degradation. Additionally, the system includes thermal depth-based loop closure detection and pose optimization, ensuring robust performance in low-texture thermal scenes. Extensive outdoor experiments demonstrate that DarkSLAM significantly outperforms existing methods like SC-Sfm-Learner and Shin et al., delivering precise localization and 3D dense mapping even in challenging nighttime environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiDAR Loop Closure Detection using Semantic Graphs with Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19382v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</p></details> |  |

They often use SLAM approaches to build such maps. Loop closures via place recognition help maintain accurate pose estimates by mitigating global drift. This paper presents a robust loop closure detection pipeline for outdoor SLAM with LiDAR-equipped robots. The method handles various LiDAR sensors with different scanning patterns, field of views and resolutions. It generates local maps from LiDAR scans and aligns them using a ground alignment module to handle both planar and non-planar motion of the LiDAR, ensuring applicability across platforms. The method uses density-preserving bird's eye view projections of these local maps and extracts ORB feature descriptors from them for place recognition. It stores the feature descriptors in a binary search tree for efficient retrieval, and self-similarity pruning addresses perceptual aliasing in repetitive environments. Extensive experiments on public and self-recorded datasets demonstrate accurate loop closure detection, long-term localization, and cross-platform multi-map alignment, agnostic to the LiDAR scanning patterns, fields of view, and motion profiles.</p></details> |  |

The first step determines whether loop closing should be performed, while the second estimates the 6-DoF pose to correct odometry drift. Current methods mostly focus on developing robust descriptors for loop closure detection, often neglecting loop pose estimation. A few methods that do include pose estimation either suffer from low accuracy or incur high computational costs. To tackle this problem, we introduce SGLC, a real-time semantic graph-guided full loop closing method, with robust loop closure detection and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. SGLC takes into account the distinct characteristics of foreground and background points. For foreground instances, it builds a semantic graph that not only abstracts point cloud representation for fast descriptor generation and matching but also guides the subsequent loop verification and initial pose estimation. Background points, meanwhile, are exploited to provide more geometric features for scan-wise descriptor construction and stable planar information for further pose refinement. Loop pose estimation employs a \mbox{coarse-fine-refine} registration scheme that considers the alignment of both instance points and background points, offering high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we integrate SGLC into a SLAM system, eliminating accumulated errors and improving overall SLAM performance. The implementation of SGLC will be released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SGLC.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The system consists of five modules: initialization, odometry, local mapping, loop closure, and global mapping, all employing the same map representation, an adaptive voxel map. The initialization provides an accurate initial state estimation and a consistent local map for subsequent modules, enabling the system to start with a highly dynamic initial state. The odometry, exploiting the short-term data association, rapidly estimates current states and detects potential system divergence. The local mapping, exploiting the mid-term data association, employs a local LiDAR-inertial bundle adjustment (BA) to refine the states (and the local map) within a sliding window of recent LiDAR scans. The loop closure detects previously visited places in the current and all previous sessions. The global mapping refines the global map with an efficient hierarchical global BA. The loop closure and global mapping both exploit long-term and multi-map data associations. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark comparison with other state-of-the-art methods across 30 sequences from three representative scenes, including narrow indoor environments using hand-held equipment, large-scale wilderness environments with aerial robots, and urban environments on vehicle platforms. Other experiments demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the initialization, the capacity to work in multiple sessions, and relocalization in degenerated environments.</p></details> |  |

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, a metric of semantic uncertainty for open-set object detections produced by visual foundation models is calculated and then incorporated into an object-level uncertainty tracking framework. Object-level uncertainties and geometric relationships between objects are used to enable robust object-level loop closure detection for unknown object classes. The above loop closure detection problem is formulated as a graph-matching problem. While graph matching, in general, is NP-Complete, a solver for an equivalent formulation of the proposed graph matching problem as a graph editing problem is tested on multiple challenging underwater scenes. Results for this solver as well as three other solvers demonstrate that the proposed methods are feasible for real-time use in marine environments for the robust, open-set, multi-object, semantic-uncertainty-aware loop closure detection. Further experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the method generalizes to large-scale terrestrial scenes.</p></details> |  |

| **[Active Loop Closure for OSM-guided Robotic Mapping in Large-Scale Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17078v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomous mapping of large-scale urban scenes presents significant challenges for autonomous robots. To mitigate the challenges, global planning, such as utilizing prior GPS trajectories from OpenStreetMap (OSM), is often used to guide the autonomous navigation of robots for mapping. However, due to factors like complex terrain, unexpected body movement, and sensor noise, the uncertainty of the robot's pose estimates inevitably increases over time, ultimately leading to the failure of robotic mapping. To address this issue, we propose a novel active loop closure procedure, enabling the robot to actively re-plan the previously planned GPS trajectory. The method can guide the robot to re-visit the previous places where the loop-closure detection can be performed to trigger the back-end optimization, effectively reducing errors and uncertainties in pose estimation.

This paper addresses these problems by tying the SLAM system with a global loop closure detection approach, which intrinsically handles these situations. However, online processing for global loop closure detection approaches is generally influenced by the size of the environment. The proposed graph-based SLAM system uses a memory management approach that only consider portions of the map to satisfy online processing requirements.

| **[Appearance-Based Loop Closure Detection for Online Large-Scale and Long-Term Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15304v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In appearance-based localization and mapping, loop closure detection is the process used to determinate if the current observation comes from a previously visited location or a new one. As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored locations, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop closure detection approach for large-scale and long-term operation. The approach is based on a memory management method, which limits the number of locations used for loop closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and frequently observed locations in a Working Memory (WM) used for loop closure detection, and transferring the others into a Long-Term Memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for additional loop closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard data sets from other appearance-based loop closure approaches, one custom data set using real images taken over a 2 km loop of our university campus, and one custom data set (7 hours) using virtual images from the racing video game ``Need for Speed: Most Wanted''.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Loop closures correct drifts in trajectory estimation to build a globally consistent map. However, a false loop closure can be fatal, so verification is required as an additional step to ensure robustness by rejecting the false positive loops. Geometric verification has been a well-acknowledged solution that leverages spatial clues provided by local feature matching to find true positives. Existing feature matching methods focus on homography and pose estimation in long-term visual localization, lacking references for geometric verification. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a unified benchmark targeting geometric verification of loop closure detection under long-term conditional variations. Furthermore, we evaluate six representative local feature matching methods (handcrafted and learning-based) under the benchmark, with in-depth analysis for limitations and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 11 figures, Accepted by IROS(2024)</p></details> |

Although deep learning-based local features excel at capturing high-level information and perform well on matching benchmarks, they struggle with generalization in continuous motion scenes, adversely affecting loop detection accuracy. Our system employs a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) strategy to optimize the training of keypoint extraction networks, enhancing their adaptability to diverse environments. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine feature tracking mechanism for learned keypoints. It begins with a direct method to approximate the relative pose between consecutive frames, followed by a feature matching method for refined pose estimation. To mitigate cumulative positioning errors, DK-SLAM incorporates a novel online learning module that utilizes binary features for loop closure detection. This module dynamically identifies loop nodes within a sequence, ensuring accurate and efficient localization. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DK-SLAM outperforms leading traditional and learning based SLAM systems, such as ORB-SLAM3 and LIFT-SLAM. These results underscore the efficacy and robustness of our DK-SLAM in varied and challenging real-world environments.</p></details> | In submission |
| **[CCTNet: A Circular Convolutional Transformer Network for LiDAR-based Place Recognition Handling Movable Objects Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10793v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is a fundamental task for robotic application, allowing robots to perform loop closure detection within simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and achieve relocalization on prior maps. Current range image-based networks use single-column convolution to maintain feature invariance to shifts in image columns caused by LiDAR viewpoint change.However, this raises the issues such as "restricted receptive fields" and "excessive focus on local regions", degrading the performance of networks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a lightweight circular convolutional Transformer network denoted as CCTNet, which boosts performance by capturing structural information in point clouds and facilitating crossdimensional interaction of spatial and channel information. Initially, a Circular Convolution Module (CCM) is introduced, expanding the network's perceptual field while maintaining feature consistency across varying LiDAR perspectives. Then, a Range Transformer Module (RTM) is proposed, which enhances place recognition accuracy in scenarios with movable objects by employing a combination of channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose an Overlap-based loss function, transforming the place recognition task from a binary loop closure classification into a regression problem linked to the overlap between LiDAR frames. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and Ford Campus datasets, CCTNet surpasses comparable methods, achieving Recall@1 of 0.924 and 0.965, and Recall@1% of 0.990 and 0.993 on the test set, showcasing a superior performance. Results on the selfcollected dataset further demonstrate the proposed method's potential for practical implementation in complex scenarios to handle movable objects, showing improved generalization in various datasets.</p></details> |  |

It is also crucial in tasks such as loop closure detection and global localization within SLAM. Previous methods utilize mundane point cloud representations as input and deep learning-based LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) approaches employing different point cloud image inputs with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformer architectures. However, the recently proposed Mamba deep learning model, combined with state space models (SSMs), holds great potential for long sequence modeling. Therefore, we developed OverlapMamba, a novel network for place recognition, which represents input range views (RVs) as sequences. In a novel way, we employ a stochastic reconstruction approach to build shift state space models, compressing the visual representation. Evaluated on three different public datasets, our method effectively detects loop closures, showing robustness even when traversing previously visited locations from different directions. Relying on raw range view inputs, it outperforms typical LiDAR and multi-view combination methods in time complexity and speed, indicating strong place recognition capabilities and real-time efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the utilization of 2D LiDAR in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) frequently encounters challenges related to motion degeneracy, particularly in geometrically similar environments. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust, accurate, and multi-sensor-fused 2D LiDAR SLAM system specifically designed for indoor mobile robots. To commence, the original LiDAR data undergoes meticulous processing through point and line extraction. Leveraging the distinctive characteristics of indoor environments, line-line constraints are established to complement other sensor data effectively, thereby augmenting the overall robustness and precision of the system. Concurrently, a tightly-coupled front-end is created, integrating data from the 2D LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry, thus enabling real-time state estimation. Building upon this solid foundation, a novel global feature point matching-based loop closure detection algorithm is proposed. This algorithm proves highly effective in mitigating front-end accumulated errors and ultimately constructs a globally consistent map. The experimental results indicate that our system fully meets real-time requirements. When compared to Cartographer, our system not only exhibits lower trajectory errors but also demonstrates stronger robustness, particularly in degeneracy problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Measurement Science and Technology: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ad3ea3/meta</p></details> |

This article investigates the use of 4D imaging radars for SLAM and analyzes the challenges in robust loop closure. Previous work indicates that 4D radars, together with inertial measurements, offer ample information for accurate odometry estimation. However, the low field of view, limited resolution, and sparse and noisy measurements render loop closure a significantly more challenging problem. Our work builds on the previous work - TBV SLAM - which was proposed for robust loop closure with 360$^\circ$ spinning radars. This article highlights and addresses challenges inherited from a directional 4D radar, such as sparsity, noise, and reduced field of view, and discusses why the common definition of a loop closure is unsuitable. By combining multiple quality measures for accurate loop closure detection adapted to 4D radar data, significant results in trajectory estimation are achieved; the absolute trajectory error is as low as 0.46 m over a distance of 1.8 km, with consistent operation over multiple environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the workshop "Radar in Robotics: Resilience from Signal to Navigation" at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Existing research on lidar-based loop closure heavily relies on dense point cloud and 360 FOV lidars. This paper proposes an out-of-the-box NDT (Normal Distribution Transform) based global descriptor, NDT-Map-Code, designed for both on-road driving and underground valet parking scenarios. NDT-Map-Code can be directly extracted from the NDT map without the need for a dense point cloud, resulting in excellent scalability and low maintenance cost. The NDT representation is leveraged to identify representative patterns, which are further encoded according to their spatial location (bearing, range, and height). Experimental results on the NIO underground parking lot dataset and the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |
| **[mmPlace: Robust Place Recognition with Intermediate Frequency Signal of Low-cost Single-chip Millimeter Wave Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04703v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is crucial for tasks like loop-closure detection and re-localization. Single-chip millimeter wave radar (single-chip radar in short) emerges as a low-cost sensor option for place recognition, with the advantage of insensitivity to degraded visual environments. However, it encounters two challenges. Firstly, sparse point cloud from single-chip radar leads to poor performance when using current place recognition methods, which assume much denser data. Secondly, its performance significantly declines in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, due to limited overlap in its field of view (FOV). We propose mmPlace, a robust place recognition system to address these challenges. Specifically, mmPlace transforms intermediate frequency (IF) signal into range azimuth heatmap and employs a spatial encoder to extract features. Additionally, to improve the performance in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, mmPlace employs a rotating platform and concatenates heatmaps in a rotation cycle, effectively expanding the system's FOV. We evaluate mmPlace's performance on the milliSonic dataset, which is collected on the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) campus, the city roads surrounding the campus, and an underground parking garage. The results demonstrate that mmPlace outperforms point cloud-based methods and achieves 87.37% recall@1 in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

In particular, orchards are a difficult case study due to structural similarity across the entire field. In this work, we address the place recognition problem in orchards resorting to 3D LiDAR data, which is considered a key modality for robustness. Hence, we propose ORCHNet, a deep-learning-based approach that maps 3D-LiDAR scans to global descriptors. Specifically, this work proposes a new global feature aggregation approach, which fuses multiple aggregation methods into a robust global descriptor. ORCHNet is evaluated on real-world data collected in orchards, comprising data from the summer and autumn seasons. To assess the robustness, we compare ORCHNet with state-of-the-art aggregation approaches on data from the same season and across seasons. Moreover, we additionally evaluate the proposed approach as part of a localization framework, where ORCHNet is used as a loop closure detector. The empirical results indicate that, on the place recognition task, ORCHNet outperforms the remaining approaches, and is also more robust across seasons. As for the localization, the edge cases where the path goes through the trees are solved when integrating ORCHNet as a loop detector, showing the potential applicability of the proposed approach in this task.

Brains also appear to learn maps, but the mechanisms are not known and it is unclear how to infer these maps from neural activity data. We present BrainSLAM; a method for performing SLAM using only population activity (local field potential, LFP) data simultaneously recorded from three brain regions in rats: hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex. This system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to decode velocity and familiarity information from wavelet scalograms of neural local field potential data recorded from rats as they navigate a 2D maze. The CNN's output drives a RatSLAM-inspired architecture, powering an attractor network which performs path integration plus a separate system which performs `loop closure' (detecting previously visited locations and correcting map aliasing errors). Together, these three components can construct faithful representations of the environment while simultaneously tracking the animal's location. This is the first demonstration of inference of a spatial map from brain recordings. Our findings expand SLAM to a new modality, enabling a new method of mapping environments and facilitating a better understanding of the role of cognitive maps in navigation and decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. 2024</p></details> |
| **[Attacking the Loop: Adversarial Attacks on Graph-based Loop Closure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06991v1)** | 2023-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement in robotics, it is becoming increasingly common for large factories and warehouses to incorporate visual SLAM (vSLAM) enabled automated robots that operate closely next to humans. This makes any adversarial attacks on vSLAM components potentially detrimental to humans working alongside them. Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is a crucial component in vSLAM that minimizes the accumulation of drift in mapping, since even a small drift can accumulate into a significant drift over time. A prior work by Kim et al., SymbioLCD2, unified visual features and semantic objects into a single graph structure for finding loop closure candidates. While this provided a performance improvement over visual feature-based LCD, it also created a single point of vulnerability for potential graph-based adversarial attacks. Unlike previously reported visual-patch based attacks, small graph perturbations are far more challenging to detect, making them a more significant threat. In this paper, we present Adversarial-LCD, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that employs an eigencentrality-based perturbation method and an SVM-RBF surrogate model with a Weisfeiler-Lehman feature extractor for attacking graph-based LCD. Our evaluation shows that the attack performance of Adversarial-LCD with the SVM-RBF surrogate model was superior to that of other machine learning surrogate algorithms, including SVM-linear, SVM-polynomial, and Bayesian classifier, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack framework. Furthermore, we show that our eigencentrality-based perturbation method outperforms other algorithms, such as Random-walk and Shortest-path, highlighting the efficiency of Adversarial-LCD's perturbation selection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VISIGRAPP 2024, 8 pages</p></details> |

However, conventional loop closure methods based on low-level geometric or image features may cause high ambiguity by not distinguishing similar scenarios. Thus, incorrect loop closures can occur. Though semantic 2D image information is considered in some literature to detect loop closures, there is little work that compares 3D scenes as an integral part of a semantic SLAM system. This paper introduces an approach, called SmSLAM+LCD, integrated into a semantic SLAM system to combine high-level 3D semantic information and low-level feature information to conduct accurate loop closure detection and effective drift reduction. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in testing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outram: One-shot Global Localization via Triangulated Scene Graph and Global Outlier Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08914v1)** | 2023-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot LiDAR localization refers to the ability to estimate the robot pose from one single point cloud, which yields significant advantages in initialization and relocalization processes. In the point cloud domain, the topic has been extensively studied as a global descriptor retrieval (i.e., loop closure detection) and pose refinement (i.e., point cloud registration) problem both in isolation or combined. However, few have explicitly considered the relationship between candidate retrieval and correspondence generation in pose estimation, leaving them brittle to substructure ambiguities. To this end, we propose a hierarchical one-shot localization algorithm called Outram that leverages substructures of 3D scene graphs for locally consistent correspondence searching and global substructure-wise outlier pruning. Such a hierarchical process couples the feature retrieval and the correspondence extraction to resolve the substructure ambiguities by conducting a local-to-global consistency refinement. We demonstrate the capability of Outram in a variety of scenarios in multiple large-scale outdoor datasets. Our implementation is open-sourced: https://github.com/Pamphlett/Outram.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

These applications encompass object recognition, image retrieval, and video analysis. LCD consists in identifying whether a robot has returned to a previously visited location, referred to as a loop, and then estimating the related roto-translation with respect to the analyzed location. Despite the numerous advantages of radar sensors, such as their ability to operate under diverse weather conditions and provide a wider range of view compared to other commonly used sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDARs), integrating radar data remains an arduous task due to intrinsic noise and distortion. To address this challenge, this research introduces RadarLCD, a novel supervised deep learning pipeline specifically designed for Loop Closure Detection using the FMCW Radar (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) sensor. RadarLCD, a learning-based LCD methodology explicitly designed for radar systems, makes a significant contribution by leveraging the pre-trained HERO (Hybrid Estimation Radar Odometry) model. Being originally developed for radar odometry, HERO's features are used to select key points crucial for LCD tasks. The methodology undergoes evaluation across a variety of FMCW Radar dataset scenes, and it is compared to state-of-the-art systems such as Scan Context for Place Recognition and ICP for Loop Closure. The results demonstrate that RadarLCD surpasses the alternatives in multiple aspects of Loop Closure Detection.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

As a result of these disruptions, pervasive in indoor spaces, magnetic field data is often omitted from navigation algorithms in indoor environments. This paper leverages the spatially-varying disruptions to Earth's magnetic field to extract positional information for use in indoor navigation algorithms. The algorithm uses a rate gyro and an array of four magnetometers to estimate the robot's pose. Additionally, the magnetometer array is used to compute attitude-invariant measurements associated with the magnetic field and its gradient. These measurements are used to detect loop closure points. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can estimate the pose of a ground robot in an indoor environment within meter accuracy.</p></details> |  |

But the LiDAR-SLAM could be disturbed by current scene moving objects, resulting in drift errors and even loop-closure failure. Thus, the ability to detect and segment moving objects is essential for high-precision positioning and building a consistent map. In this paper, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans to improve the odometry and loop-closure accuracy of SLAM. We propose a novel 3D Sequential Moving-Object-Segmentation (3D-SeqMOS) method that can accurately segment the scene into moving and static objects, such as moving and static cars. Different from the existing projected-image method, we process the raw 3D point cloud and build a 3D convolution neural network for MOS task. In addition, to make full use of the spatio-temporal information of point cloud, we propose a point cloud residual mechanism using the spatial features of current scan and the temporal features of previous residual scans. Besides, we build a complete SLAM framework to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of 3D-SeqMOS. Experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset show that our proposed 3D-SeqMOS method can effectively detect moving objects and improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry and loop-closure detection. The test results show our 3D-SeqMOS outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.4%. We extend the proposed method to the SemanticKITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve the 2nd in the leaderboard, showing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Doing so achieves rigid transform invariance during place recognition, while ignoring the effects of radar multipath and ring noises. In addition, we compute the radar similarity distance using mutable threshold to mitigate variability of the similarity score, and reduce the time complexity of processing a copious radar data with hierarchical retrieval.

Traditional large-scale map merging methods are fragile to incorrect data associations, and are primarily limited to working only offline. AutoMerge utilizes multi-perspective fusion and adaptive loop closure detection for accurate data associations, and it uses incremental merging to assemble large maps from individual trajectory segments given in random order and with no initial estimations. Furthermore, after assembling the segments, AutoMerge performs fine matching and pose-graph optimization to globally smooth the merged map. We demonstrate AutoMerge on both city-scale merging (120km) and campus-scale repeated merging (4.5km x 8). The experiments show that AutoMerge (i) surpasses the second- and third- best methods by 14% and 24% recall in segment retrieval, (ii) achieves comparable 3D mapping accuracy for 120 km large-scale map assembly, (iii) and it is robust to temporally-spaced revisits. To the best of our knowledge, AutoMerge is the first mapping approach that can merge hundreds of kilometers of individual segments without the aid of GPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 20 figures, IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 2023</p></details> |

It enables the recognition of previously visited scenes to eliminate pose and map estimate drifts arising from long-term exploration. However, current appearance-based LCD methods face significant challenges, including high computational costs, viewpoint variance, and dynamic objects in scenes. This paper introduced an online appearance based LCD using local superpixel grids descriptor and dynamic node, i.e, LSGDDN-LCD, to find similarities between scenes via hand-crafted features extracted from LSGD. Unlike traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) based LCD, which requires pre-training, we proposed an adaptive mechanism to group similar images called $\textbf{\textit{dynamic}}$ $\textbf{\textit{node}}$, which incrementally adjusted the database in an online manner, allowing for efficient and online retrieval of previously viewed images without need of the pre-training. Experimental results confirmed that the LSGDDN-LCD significantly improved LCD precision-recall and efficiency, and outperformed several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple typical datasets, indicating its great potential as a generic LCD framework.</p></details> |  |

Recently, 3D LiDAR-based localization methods have used retrieval-based place recognition to find revisited places efficiently. However, when deployed in challenging real-world scenarios, the place recognition models become more complex, which comes at the cost of high computational demand. This work tackles this problem from an information-retrieval perspective, adopting a first-retrieve-then-re-ranking paradigm, where an initial loop candidate ranking, generated from a 3D place recognition model, is re-ordered by a proposed lightweight transformer-based re-ranking approach (TReR). The proposed approach relies on global descriptors only, being agnostic to the place recognition model. The experimental evaluation, conducted on the KITTI Odometry dataset, where we compared TReR with s.o.t.a. re-ranking approaches such as alphaQE and SGV, indicate the robustness and efficiency when compared to alphaQE while offering a good trade-off between robustness and efficiency when compared to SGV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been submitted to 26th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems ITSC 2023</p></details> |
| **[Foundations of Spatial Perception for Robotics: Hierarchical Representations and Real-time Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07154v1)** | 2023-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D spatial perception is the problem of building and maintaining an actionable and persistent representation of the environment in real-time using sensor data and prior knowledge. Despite the fast-paced progress in robot perception, most existing methods either build purely geometric maps (as in traditional SLAM) or flat metric-semantic maps that do not scale to large environments or large dictionaries of semantic labels. The first part of this paper is concerned with representations: we show that scalable representations for spatial perception need to be hierarchical in nature. Hierarchical representations are efficient to store, and lead to layered graphs with small treewidth, which enable provably efficient inference. We then introduce an example of hierarchical representation for indoor environments, namely a 3D scene graph, and discuss its structure and properties. The second part of the paper focuses on algorithms to incrementally construct a 3D scene graph as the robot explores the environment. Our algorithms combine 3D geometry, topology (to cluster the places into rooms), and geometric deep learning (e.g., to classify the type of rooms the robot is moving across). The third part of the paper focuses on algorithms to maintain and correct 3D scene graphs during long-term operation. We propose hierarchical descriptors for loop closure detection and describe how to correct a scene graph in response to loop closures, by solving a 3D scene graph optimization problem. We conclude the paper by combining the proposed perception algorithms into Hydra, a real-time spatial perception system that builds a 3D scene graph from visual-inertial data in real-time. We showcase Hydra's performance in photo-realistic simulations and real data collected by a Clearpath Jackal robots and a Unitree A1 robot. We release an open-source implementation of Hydra at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 19 figures; submitted to International Journal of Robotics Research</p></details> |

This paper describes Hydra-Multi, the first multi-robot spatial perception system capable of constructing a multi-robot 3D scene graph online from sensor data collected by robots in a team. In particular, we develop a centralized system capable of constructing a joint 3D scene graph by taking incremental inputs from multiple robots, effectively finding the relative transforms between the robots' frames, and incorporating loop closure detections to correctly reconcile the scene graph nodes from different robots. We evaluate Hydra-Multi on simulated and real scenarios and show it is able to reconstruct accurate 3D scene graphs online. We also demonstrate Hydra-Multi's capability of supporting heterogeneous teams by fusing different map representations built by robots with different sensor suites.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Loop Closure Detection Based on Object-level Spatial Layout and Semantic Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05146v2)** | 2023-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems face challenges in detecting loop closure under the circumstance of large viewpoint changes. In this paper, we present an object-based loop closure detection method based on the spatial layout and semanic consistency of the 3D scene graph. Firstly, we propose an object-level data association approach based on the semantic information from semantic labels, intersection over union (IoU), object color, and object embedding. Subsequently, multi-view bundle adjustment with the associated objects is utilized to jointly optimize the poses of objects and cameras. We represent the refined objects as a 3D spatial graph with semantics and topology. Then, we propose a graph matching approach to select correspondence objects based on the structure layout and semantic property similarity of vertices' neighbors. Finally, we jointly optimize camera trajectories and object poses in an object-level pose graph optimization, which results in a globally consistent map. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data association approach can construct more accurate 3D semantic maps, and our loop closure method is more robust than point-based and object-based methods in circumstances with large viewpoint changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[PADLoC: LiDAR-Based Deep Loop Closure Detection and Registration Using Panoptic Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09699v3)** | 2023-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key component of graph-based SLAM systems is the ability to detect loop closures in a trajectory to reduce the drift accumulated over time from the odometry. Most LiDAR-based methods achieve this goal by using only the geometric information, disregarding the semantics of the scene. In this work, we introduce PADLoC for joint loop closure detection and registration in LiDAR-based SLAM frameworks. We propose a novel transformer-based head for point cloud matching and registration, and to leverage panoptic information during training time. In particular, we propose a novel loss function that reframes the matching problem as a classification task for the semantic labels and as a graph connectivity assignment for the instance labels. During inference, PADLoC does not require panoptic annotations, making it more versatile than other methods. Additionally, we show that using two shared matching and registration heads with their source and target inputs swapped increases the overall performance by enforcing forward-backward consistency. We perform extensive evaluations of PADLoC on multiple real-world datasets demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results. The code of our work is publicly available at http://padloc.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized SC-F-LOAM: Optimized Fast LiDAR Odometry and Mapping Using Scan Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04932v2)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR odometry can achieve accurate vehicle pose estimation for short driving range or in small-scale environments, but for long driving range or in large-scale environments, the accuracy deteriorates as a result of cumulative estimation errors. This drawback necessitates the inclusion of loop closure detection in a SLAM framework to suppress the adverse effects of cumulative errors. To improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we propose a new LiDAR-based SLAM method which uses F-LOAM as LiDAR odometry, Scan Context for loop closure detection, and GTSAM for global optimization. In our approach, an adaptive distance threshold (instead of a fixed threshold) is employed for loop closure detection, which achieves more accurate loop closure detection results. Besides, a feature-based matching method is used in our approach to compute vehicle pose transformations between loop closure point cloud pairs, instead of using the raw point cloud obtained by the LiDAR sensor, which significantly reduces the computation time. The KITTI dataset is used for verifications of our method, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms typical LiDAR odometry/SLAM methods in the literature. Our code is made publicly available for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |

Natural and unstructured environments present many additional challenges for the tasks of long-term localisation but these environments are not represented in currently available datasets. To address this we introduce Wild-Places, a challenging large-scale dataset for lidar place recognition in unstructured, natural environments. Wild-Places contains eight lidar sequences collected with a handheld sensor payload over the course of fourteen months, containing a total of 63K undistorted lidar submaps along with accurate 6DoF ground truth. Our dataset contains multiple revisits both within and between sequences, allowing for both intra-sequence (i.e. loop closure detection) and inter-sequence (i.e. re-localisation) place recognition. We also benchmark several state-of-the-art approaches to demonstrate the challenges that this dataset introduces, particularly the case of long-term place recognition due to natural environments changing over time.

| **[Region Prediction for Efficient Robot Localization on Large Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00295v1)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing already explored places (a.k.a. place recognition) is a fundamental task in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to enable robot relocalization and loop closure detection. In topological SLAM the recognition takes place by comparing a signature (or feature vector) associated to the current node with the signatures of the nodes in the known map. However, as the number of nodes increases, matching the current node signature against all the existing ones becomes inefficient and thwarts real-time navigation. In this paper we propose a novel approach to pre-select a subset of map nodes for place recognition. The map nodes are clustered during exploration and each cluster is associated with a region. The region labels become the prediction targets of a deep neural network and, during navigation, only the nodes associated with the regions predicted with high probability are considered for matching. While the proposed technique can be integrated in different SLAM approaches, in this work we describe an effective integration with RTAB-Map (a popular framework for real-time topological SLAM) which allowed us to design and run several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. All the code and material from the experiments will be available online at https://github.com/MI-BioLab/region-learner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Planar Pose Estimation via UWB Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06779v4)** | 2023-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation is an essential part of autonomous systems. Integrating the Ultra-Wideband(UWB) technique has been shown to correct the long-term estimation drift and bypass the complexity of loop closure detection. However, few works on robotics adopt UWB as a stand-alone state estimation solution. The primary purpose of this work is to investigate planar pose estimation using only UWB range measurements and study the estimator's statistical efficiency. We prove the excellent property of a two-step scheme, which says that we can refine a consistent estimator to be asymptotically efficient by one step of Gauss-Newton iteration. Grounded on this result, we design the GN-ULS estimator and evaluate it through simulations and collected datasets. GN-ULS attains millimeter and sub-degree level accuracy on our static datasets and attains centimeter and degree level accuracy on our dynamic datasets, presenting the possibility of using only UWB for real-time state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update the content and improve consistency with the ICRA version</p></details> |

We interpret the Cartesian birds' eye view (BEV) image projected from 3D LiDAR points as layered distribution of structures. To recover elevation information from BEVs, we slice them at different heights, and connected pixels at each level will form contours. Each contour is parameterized by abstract information, e.g., pixel count, center position, covariance, and mean height. The similarity of two BEVs is calculated in sequential discrete and continuous steps. The first step considers the geometric consensus of graph-like constellations formed by contours in particular localities. The second step models the majority of contours as a 2.5D Gaussian mixture model, which is used to calculate correlation and optimize relative transform in continuous space. A retrieval key is designed to accelerate the search of a database indexed by layered KD-trees. We validate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with recent works on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ICRA 2023</p></details> |

Our proposed SLAM system is consist of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) subsystems. We propose the LIO subsystem utilizing the measurement from the LiDAR and the inertial sensors to build the local odometry map, and propose the VIO subsystem which takes in the visual information to construct the 2D-3D associated map. Then, we propose an iterative Kalman Filter-based optimization function to optimize the local project-based 2D-to-3D photo-metric error between the projected image pixels and the local 3D points to make the robust 2D-3D alignment. Finally, we have also proposed the back-end pose graph global optimization and the elaborately designed loop closure detection network to improve the accuracy of the whole SLAM system. Extensive experiments deployed on the UGV in complicated real-world circumstances demonstrate that our proposed LiDAR-Visual-Inertial localization system outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>2022 ...</summary><p>2022 12th International Conference on CYBER Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (IEEE Cyber Oral)</p></details> |

Existing tactile surface reconstruction methods rely on external sensors or have strong prior assumptions, making the operation complex and limiting their application scenarios. This paper presents a framework for low-drift surface reconstruction through multiple tactile measurements, Tac2Structure. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed method uses only a new vision-based tactile sensor without relying on external devices. Aiming at the difficulty that reconstruction accuracy is easily affected by the pressure at contact, we propose a correction algorithm to adapt it. The proposed method also reduces the accumulative errors that occur easily during global object surface reconstruction. Multi-frame tactile measurements can accurately reconstruct object surfaces by jointly using the point cloud registration algorithm, loop-closure detection algorithm based on deep learning, and pose graph optimization algorithm. Experiments verify that Tac2Structure can achieve millimeter-level accuracy in reconstructing the surface of objects, providing accurate tactile information for the robot to perceive the surrounding environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics And Automation Letters</p></details> |

With the success of DL approaches in learning useful information from 3D LiDARs, place recognition has also benefited from this modality, which has led to higher re-localization and loop-closure detection performance, particularly, in environments with significant changing conditions. Despite the progress in this field, the extraction of proper and efficient descriptors from 3D LiDAR data that are invariant to changing conditions and orientation is still an unsolved challenge. To address this problem, this work proposes a novel 3D LiDAR-based deep learning network (named AttDLNet) that uses a range-based proxy representation for point clouds and an attention network with stacked attention layers to selectively focus on long-range context and inter-feature relationships. The proposed network is trained and validated on the KITTI dataset and an ablation study is presented to assess the novel attention network. Results show that adding attention to the network improves performance, leading to efficient loop closures, and outperforming an established 3D LiDAR-based place recognition approach. From the ablation study, results indicate that the middle encoder layers have the highest mean performance, while deeper layers are more robust to orientation change.

| **[GraffMatch: Global Matching of 3D Lines and Planes for Wide Baseline LiDAR Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12745v1)** | 2022-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using geometric landmarks like lines and planes can increase navigation accuracy and decrease map storage requirements compared to commonly-used LiDAR point cloud maps. However, landmark-based registration for applications like loop closure detection is challenging because a reliable initial guess is not available. Global landmark matching has been investigated in the literature, but these methods typically use ad hoc representations of 3D line and plane landmarks that are not invariant to large viewpoint changes, resulting in incorrect matches and high registration error. To address this issue, we adopt the affine Grassmannian manifold to represent 3D lines and planes and prove that the distance between two landmarks is invariant to rotation and translation if a shift operation is performed before applying the Grassmannian metric. This invariance property enables the use of our graph-based data association framework for identifying landmark matches that can subsequently be used for registration in the least-squares sense. Evaluated on a challenging landmark matching and registration task using publicly-available LiDAR datasets, our approach yields a 1.7x and 3.5x improvement in successful registrations compared to methods that use viewpoint-dependent centroid and "closest point" representations, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to RA-L; 8 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.08556</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a faster, lighter and stronger approach that can generate models with fewer parameters and can spend less time in the inference stage. We designed RepVGG-lite as the backbone network in our architecture, it is more discriminative than other general networks in the Place Recognition task. RepVGG-lite has more speed advantages while achieving higher performance. We extract only one scale patch-level descriptors from global descriptors in the feature extraction stage. Then we design a trainable feature matcher to exploit both spatial relationships of the features and their visual appearance, which is based on the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforming recent other state-of-the-art learned approaches, and achieving even higher inference speed. Our system has 14 times less params than Patch-NetVLAD, 6.8 times lower theoretical FLOPs, and run faster 21 and 33 times in feature extraction and feature matching. Moreover, the performance of our approach is 0.5\% better than Patch-NetVLAD in Recall@1.

Our approach decreases the computational overhead of classical approaches by pruning the search space of potential loop closures, prior to evaluation by a typical multi-robot SLAM pipeline. Wi-Closure achieves this by identifying candidates that are spatially close to each other by using sensing over the wireless communication signal between robots, even when they are operating in non-line-of-sight or in remote areas of the environment from one another. We demonstrate the validity of our approach in simulation and hardware experiments. Our results show that using Wi-closure greatly reduces computation time, by 54% in simulation and by 77% in hardware compared, with a multi-robot SLAM baseline. Importantly, this is achieved without sacrificing accuracy. Using Wi-Closure reduces absolute trajectory estimation error by 99% in simulation and 89.2% in hardware experiments. This improvement is due in part to Wi-Closure's ability to avoid catastrophic optimization failure that typically occurs with classical approaches in challenging repetitive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages without references</p></details> |

This is one of the most critical questions that any intelligent system should answer to decide whether it navigates to a previously visited area. This problem has long been acknowledged for its challenging nature in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), wherein the robot needs to correctly associate the incoming sensory data to the database allowing consistent map generation. The significant advances in computer vision achieved over the last 20 years, the increased computational power, and the growing demand for long-term exploration contributed to efficiently performing such a complex task with inexpensive perception sensors. In this article, visual loop closure detection, which formulates a solution based solely on appearance input data, is surveyed. We start by briefly introducing place recognition and SLAM concepts in robotics. Then, we describe a loop closure detection system's structure, covering an extensive collection of topics, including the feature extraction, the environment representation, the decision-making step, and the evaluation process. We conclude by discussing open and new research challenges, particularly concerning the robustness in dynamic environments, the computational complexity, and scalability in long-term operations.

Each robot explores a section of the environment and communicates onboard pose estimates and maps to a central server to build an optimized global multi-robot map. Naturally, inconsistencies can arise between onboard and server estimates due to onboard odometry drift, failures, or degeneracies. The mapping server can correct and overcome such failure cases using computationally expensive operations such as inter-robot loop closure detection and multi-modal mapping. However, the individual robots do not benefit from the collaborative map if the mapping server provides no feedback. Although server updates from the multi-robot map can greatly alleviate the robotic mission strategically, most existing work lacks them, due to their associated computational and bandwidth-related costs. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mapping framework that enables global mapping consistency among robots and the mapping server. In particular, we propose graph spectral analysis, at different spatial scales, to detect structural differences between robot and server graphs, and to generate necessary constraints for the individual robot pose graphs. Our approach specifically finds the nodes that correspond to the drift's origin rather than the nodes where the error becomes too large. We thoroughly analyze and validate our proposed framework using several real-world multi-robot field deployments where we show improvements of the onboard system up to 90\% and can recover the onboard estimation from localization failures and even from the degeneracies within its estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.00308</p></details> |

While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness, increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes, with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation while remaining lightweight.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Through the Lens of Doubt: Robust and Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13464v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty (SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible and Efficient Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Sequential Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04282v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference, and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to the second-best baseline.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the "map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore, we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works across diverse test datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025 Workshop CrocoDL</p></details> |

The solution we propose employs panoramic images and deep learning models, which are fine-tuned with triplet loss functions that integrate curriculum learning strategies. By progressively presenting more challenging examples during training, these loss functions enable the model to learn more discriminative and robust feature representations, overcoming the limitations of conventional contrastive loss functions. After training, VPR is tackled in two steps: coarse (room retrieval) and fine (position estimation). The results demonstrate that the curriculum-based triplet losses consistently outperform standard contrastive loss functions, particularly under challenging perceptual conditions. To thoroughly assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of the proposed method, it is evaluated in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. The approach is tested against common challenges in real operation conditions, including severe illumination changes, the presence of dynamic visual effects such as noise and occlusions, and scenarios with limited training data. The results show that the proposed framework performs competitively in all these situations, achieving high recognition accuracy and demonstrating its potential as a reliable solution for real-world robotic applications.

| **[SAGE: Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25723v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have developed VPR solutions using event cameras, which asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution. However, these approaches rely on dense representations of the inherently sparse camera output and require tens to hundreds of milliseconds of event data to predict a place. Here, we break this paradigm with Flash, a lightweight VPR system that predicts places using sub-millisecond slices of event data. Our method is based on the observation that active pixel locations provide strong discriminative features for VPR. Flash encodes these active pixel locations using efficient binary frames and computes similarities via fast bitwise operations, which are then normalized based on the relative event activity in the query and reference frames. Flash improves Recall@1 for sub-millisecond VPR over existing baselines by 11.33x on the indoor QCR-Event-Dataset and 5.92x on the 8 km Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset. Moreover, our approach reduces the duration for which the robot must operate without awareness of its position, as evidenced by a localization latency metric we term Time to Correct Match (TCM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras.</p></details> |  |

Whilst the rapid expansion in the field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats, making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for easily setting up multiple conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, under review</p></details> |

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above. Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint. In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks; LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching. Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs' vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs. The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$ computational efficiency gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble-Based Event Camera Place Recognition Under Varying Illumination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01968v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions, VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and benchmarking framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[HypeVPR: Exploring Hyperbolic Space for Perspective to Equirectangular Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04764v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine search strategy to enable flexible control over accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and ensure robust matching even between descriptors from different image types. This approach allows HypeVPR to outperform existing methods while significantly accelerating retrieval and reducing database storage requirements. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[TextInPlace: Indoor Visual Place Recognition in Repetitive Structures with Scene Text Spotting and Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06501v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial capability for long-term autonomous robots, enabling them to identify previously visited locations using visual information. However, existing methods remain limited in indoor settings due to the highly repetitive structures inherent in such environments. We observe that scene texts frequently appear in indoor spaces and can help distinguish visually similar but different places. This inspires us to propose TextInPlace, a simple yet effective VPR framework that integrates Scene Text Spotting (STS) to mitigate visual perceptual ambiguity in repetitive indoor environments. Specifically, TextInPlace adopts a dual-branch architecture within a local parameter sharing network. The VPR branch employs attention-based aggregation to extract global descriptors for coarse-grained retrieval, while the STS branch utilizes a bridging text spotter to detect and recognize scene texts. Finally, the discriminative texts are filtered to compute text similarity and re-rank the top-K retrieved images. To bridge the gap between current text-based repetitive indoor scene datasets and the typical scenarios encountered in robot navigation, we establish an indoor VPR benchmark dataset, called Maze-with-Text. Extensive experiments on both custom and public datasets demonstrate that TextInPlace achieves superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on appearance information. The dataset, code, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/HqiTao/TextInPlace.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

When browsing real estate or navigating unfamiliar spaces, they intuitively select a small set of views that summarize the spatial layout. Inspired by this ability, we introduce scene summarization, the task of condensing long, continuous scene videos into a compact set of spatially diverse keyframes that facilitate global spatial reasoning. Unlike conventional video summarization-which focuses on user-edited, fragmented clips and often ignores spatial continuity-our goal is to mimic how humans abstract spatial layout from sparse views. We propose SceneSum, a two-stage self-supervised pipeline that first clusters video frames using visual place recognition to promote spatial diversity, then selects representative keyframes from each cluster under resource constraints. When camera trajectories are available, a lightweight supervised loss further refines clustering and selection. Experiments on real and simulated indoor datasets show that SceneSum produces more spatially informative summaries and outperforms existing video summarization baselines.</p></details> |  |

While Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has embraced Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance descriptor robustness, LPR has relied on task-specific models with limited use of pre-trained foundation-level knowledge. This is due to the lack of 3D foundation models and the challenges of using VFM with LiDAR point clouds. To tackle this, we introduce ImLPR, a novel pipeline that employs a pre-trained DINOv2 VFM to generate rich descriptors for LPR. To the best of our knowledge, ImLPR is the first method to utilize a VFM for LPR while retaining the majority of pre-trained knowledge. ImLPR converts raw point clouds into novel three-channel Range Image Views (RIV) to leverage VFM in the LiDAR domain. It employs MultiConv adapters and Patch-InfoNCE loss for effective feature learning. We validate ImLPR on public datasets and outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple evaluation metrics in both intra- and inter-session LPR. Comprehensive ablations on key design choices such as channel composition, RIV, adapters, and the patch-level loss quantify each component's impact. We release ImLPR as open source for the robotics community: https://github.com/minwoo0611/ImLPR.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL2...</summary><p>CoRL2025 Accepted, 23 Pages, 15 Figures and 14 Tables</p></details> |

While these methods are commonly applied, their effects on system behavior can be unpredictable and can actually make performance worse in certain situations. In this work, we present a new supervised learning approach that learns to predict the per-frame sequence matching receptiveness (SMR) of VPR techniques, enabling the system to selectively decide when to trust the output of a sequence matching system. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying VPR technique and effectively predicts SMR, and hence significantly improves VPR performance across a large range of state-of-the-art and classical VPR techniques (namely CosPlace, MixVPR, EigenPlaces, SALAD, AP-GeM, NetVLAD and SAD), and across three benchmark VPR datasets (Nordland, Oxford RobotCar, and SFU-Mountain). We also provide insights into a complementary approach that uses the predictor to replace discarded matches, and present ablation studies including an analysis of the interactions between our SMR predictor and the selected sequence length.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, Accepted to the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Today, purely data-driven end-to-end models are dominant solutions to this problem. Despite advantages such as flexibility and adaptability, the requirement of a large amount of training data and limited interpretability are the main bottlenecks for their practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose a hierarchical system that utilizes recent advances in model predictive control, traversability estimation, visual place recognition, and pose estimation, employing topological graphs as a representation of the target environment. Using such a combination, we provide a scalable system with a higher level of interpretability compared to end-to-end approaches. Extensive real-world experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSFormer: A Dual-Scale Cross-Learning Transformer for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18444v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former (DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large (SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations. Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLM-Guided Visual Place Recognition for Planet-Scale Geo-Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17455v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geo-localization from a single image at planet scale (essentially an advanced or extreme version of the kidnapped robot problem) is a fundamental and challenging task in applications such as navigation, autonomous driving and disaster response due to the vast diversity of locations, environmental conditions, and scene variations. Traditional retrieval-based methods for geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning. However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level (up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Place Recognition for Large-Scale UAV Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15089v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images, systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance, leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust, orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover, steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures, achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep learning-based solutions predominantly focus on single-frame embeddings, neglecting the temporal coherence present in image sequences. This paper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies spatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable, end-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D convolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator, termed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term spatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models directional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing kernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection, yielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance shifts. To further enhance inter-class separability, we incorporate a quadruplet loss that optimizes both positive alignment and multi-negative divergence within each batch. Unlike prior VPR methods that treat temporal aggregation as post-processing, OptiCorNet learns sequence-level embeddings directly, enabling more effective end-to-end place recognition. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under challenging seasonal and viewpoint variations.</p></details> | 5 figures |

However, most existing approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.

The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal. In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA) 2025</p></details> |

Recent breakthroughs in deep learning architectures and training regimes have led to methods with improved robustness to factors like environment appearance change, but with the downside that the required training and/or matching compute scales with the number of distinct environmental conditions encountered. Here, we propose Hyperdimensional One Place Signatures (HOPS) to simultaneously improve the performance, compute and scalability of these state-of-the-art approaches by fusing the descriptors from multiple reference sets captured under different conditions. HOPS scales to any number of environmental conditions by leveraging the Hyperdimensional Computing framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach is highly generalizable and consistently improves recall performance across all evaluated VPR methods and datasets by large margins. Arbitrarily fusing reference images without compute penalty enables numerous other useful possibilities, three of which we demonstrate here: descriptor dimensionality reduction with no performance penalty, stacking synthetic images, and coarse localization to an entire traverse or environmental section.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into ICCV 2025</p></details> |

This paper extensively analyzes the effect of four adversarial attacks common in other perception tasks and four novel VPR-specific attacks on VPR localization performance. We then propose how to close the loop between VPR, an Adversarial Attack Detector (AAD), and active navigation decisions by demonstrating the performance benefit of simulated AADs in a novel experiment paradigm -- which we detail for the robotics community to use as a system framework. In the proposed experiment paradigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies can improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement -- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can be achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75% and up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including: Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an `Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on these results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this work highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy navigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.</p></details> |  |

Visual place recognition, a critical component for navigation, is often hampered by the high resource demands of conventional systems, making them unsuitable for small-scale robotic platforms which still require accurate long-endurance localization. Although neuromorphic approaches offer potential for greater efficiency, real-time edge deployment remains constrained by the complexity of bio-realistic networks. In order to overcome this challenge, fusion of hardware and algorithms is critical to employ this specialized computing paradigm. Here, we demonstrate a neuromorphic localization system that performs competitive place recognition in up to 8 kilometers of traversal using models as small as 180 kilobytes with 44,000 parameters, while consuming less than 8% of the energy required by conventional methods. Our Locational Encoding with Neuromorphic Systems (LENS) integrates spiking neural networks, an event-based dynamic vision sensor, and a neuromorphic processor within a single SynSense Speck chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient localization on a hexapod robot. When compared to a benchmark place recognition method, Sum-of-Absolute-Differences (SAD), LENS performs comparably in overall precision. LENS represents an accurate fully neuromorphic localization system capable of large-scale, on-device deployment for energy efficient robotic place recognition.

In robotics, VPR is also referred to as Loop Closure Detection, which emphasizes spatial-temporal verification within a sequence. However, designing local features specifically for VPR is impractical, and relying on motion sequences imposes limitations. Inspired by these observations, we propose a novel, simple re-ranking method that refines global features through a Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approach under embodied constraints. First, we analyze the practical feasibility of embodied constraints in VPR and categorize them according to existing datasets, which include GPS tags, sequential timestamps, local feature matching, and self-similarity matrices. We then propose a learning-based MoF weight-computation approach, utilizing a multi-metric loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public datasets with minimal additional computational overhead. For instance, with only 25 KB of additional parameters and a processing time of 10 microseconds per frame, our method achieves a 0.9\% improvement over a DINOv2-based baseline performance on the Pitts-30k test set.</p></details> | 17 Pages |

However, these methods have failed to fully exploit key concepts of FM, such as the effective utilization of extensive training sets, and they have overlooked the potential of classical aggregation methods, such as GeM and NetVLAD. Building on these insights, we revive classical feature aggregation methods and develop more fundamental VPR models, collectively termed SuperPlace. First, we introduce a supervised label alignment method that enables training across various VPR datasets within a unified framework. Second, we propose G$^2$M, a compact feature aggregation method utilizing two GeMs, where one GeM learns the principal components of feature maps along the channel dimension and calibrates the output of the other. Third, we propose the secondary fine-tuning (FT$^2$) strategy for NetVLAD-Linear (NVL). NetVLAD first learns feature vectors in a high-dimensional space and then compresses them into a lower-dimensional space via a single linear layer. Extensive experiments highlight our contributions and demonstrate the superiority of SuperPlace. Specifically, G$^2$M achieves promising results with only one-tenth of the feature dimensions compared to recent methods. Moreover, NVL-FT$^2$ ranks first on the MSLS leaderboard.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Feature Complementation Architecture for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12401v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) plays a crucial role in robotic localization and navigation. The key challenge lies in constructing feature representations that are robust to environmental changes. Existing methods typically adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision Transformers (ViTs) as feature extractors. However, these architectures excel in different aspects -- CNNs are effective at capturing local details. At the same time, ViTs are better suited for modeling global context, making it difficult to leverage the strengths of both. To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation network (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture with a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM). The DFM performs dynamic feature fusion through joint modeling of spatial and channel-wise dependencies. Furthermore, to enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the ViT branch for VPR tasks, we introduce lightweight frequency-to-spatial fusion adapters into the frozen ViT backbone. These adapters enable task-specific adaptation with controlled parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple VPR benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed LGCN consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of localization accuracy and robustness, validating its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions are built to specifically work for one of these tasks, and are known to fail when the requirements slightly change or when they meet out-of-distribution data. In this paper we combine a variety of existing methods, training techniques, and datasets to train a retrieval model, called MegaLoc, that is performant on multiple tasks. We find that MegaLoc (1) achieves state of the art on a large number of Visual Place Recognition datasets, (2) impressive results on common Landmark Retrieval datasets, and (3) sets a new state of the art for Visual Localization on the LaMAR datasets, where we only changed the retrieval method to the existing localization pipeline.

Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture, Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for generating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor inputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot. Deployed on real in-house mobile robots, Astra achieves high end-to-end mission success rate across diverse indoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Astra...</summary><p>Astra Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[EDTformer: An Efficient Decoder Transformer for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00784v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) aims to determine the general geographical location of a query image by retrieving visually similar images from a large geo-tagged database. To obtain a global representation for each place image, most approaches typically focus on the aggregation of deep features extracted from a backbone through using current prominent architectures (e.g., CNNs, MLPs, pooling layer, and transformer encoder), giving little attention to the transformer decoder. However, we argue that its strong capability to capture contextual dependencies and generate accurate features holds considerable potential for the VPR task. To this end, we propose an Efficient Decoder Transformer (EDTformer) for feature aggregation, which consists of several stacked simplified decoder blocks followed by two linear layers to directly produce robust and discriminative global representations. Specifically, we do this by formulating deep features as the keys and values, as well as a set of learnable parameters as the queries. Our EDTformer can fully utilize the contextual information within deep features, then gradually decode and aggregate the effective features into the learnable queries to output the global representations. Moreover, to provide more powerful deep features for EDTformer and further facilitate the robustness, we use the foundation model DINOv2 as the backbone and propose a Low-rank Parallel Adaptation (LoPA) method to enhance its performance in VPR, which can refine the intermediate features of the backbone progressively in a memory- and parameter-efficient way. As a result, our method not only outperforms single-stage VPR methods on multiple benchmark datasets, but also outperforms two-stage VPR methods which add a re-ranking with considerable cost. Code will be available at https://github.com/Tong-Jin01/EDTformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by T-CSVT2025</p></details> |

To address these gaps, we introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for street-level place recognition in complex, pedestrian-only environments. The dataset comprises 78,575 annotated images and 2,512 video clips captured across 207 locations in a ~70,800 $\mathrm{m}^2$ open-air commercial district in Chengdu, China. Each image is labeled with precise GPS coordinates, timestamp, and textual metadata, and covers varied lighting conditions, viewpoints, and timeframes. MMS-VPR follows a systematic and replicable data collection protocol with minimal device requirements, lowering the barrier for scalable dataset creation. Importantly, the dataset forms an inherent spatial graph with 125 edges, 81 nodes, and 1 subgraph, enabling structure-aware place recognition. We further define two application-specific subsets -- Dataset_Edges and Dataset_Points -- to support fine-grained and graph-based evaluation tasks. Extensive benchmarks using conventional VPR models, graph neural networks, and multimodal baselines show substantial improvements when leveraging multimodal and structural cues. MMS-VPR facilitates future research at the intersection of computer vision, geospatial understanding, and multimodal reasoning.

For VPR task, often fewer discriminative local regions in an image produce important effects while mundane background regions do not contribute or even cause perceptual aliasing because of easy overlap. However, existing methods lack precisely modeling and full exploitation of these discriminative regions. In this paper, we propose the Focus on Local (FoL) approach to stimulate the performance of image retrieval and re-ranking in VPR simultaneously by mining and exploiting reliable discriminative local regions in images and introducing pseudo-correlation supervision. First, we design two losses, Extraction-Aggregation Spatial Alignment Loss (SAL) and Foreground-Background Contrast Enhancement Loss (CEL), to explicitly model reliable discriminative local regions and use them to guide the generation of global representations and efficient re-ranking. Second, we introduce a weakly-supervised local feature training strategy based on pseudo-correspondences obtained from aggregating global features to alleviate the lack of local correspondences ground truth for the VPR task. Third, we suggest an efficient re-ranking pipeline that is efficiently and precisely based on discriminative region guidance. Finally, experimental results show that our FoL achieves the state-of-the-art on multiple VPR benchmarks in both image retrieval and re-ranking stages and also significantly outperforms existing two-stage VPR methods in terms of computational efficiency.

However, limited network bandwidth necessitates image-quality reduction and thus the degradation of global image descriptors, reducing VPR accuracy. We address this issue at the descriptor extraction level with a knowledge-distillation methodology that learns feature representations from high-quality images to extract more discriminative descriptors from low-quality images. Our approach includes the Inter-channel Correlation Knowledge Distillation (ICKD) loss, Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, and Triplet loss. We validate the proposed losses on multiple VPR methods and datasets subjected to JPEG compression, resolution reduction, and video quantization. We obtain significant improvements in VPR recall rates under all three tested modalities of lowered image quality. Furthermore, we fill a gap in VPR literature on video-based data and its influence on VPR performance. This work contributes to more reliable place recognition in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

A commonly used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming. To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by T-PAMI2025</p></details> |

However, most existing VPR datasets are limited to single-viewpoint scenarios, leading to reduced recognition accuracy, particularly in multi-directional driving or feature-sparse scenes. Moreover, obtaining additional data to mitigate these limitations is often expensive. This paper introduces a novel training paradigm to improve the performance of existing VPR networks by enhancing multi-view diversity within current datasets through uncertainty estimation and NeRF-based data augmentation. Specifically, we initially train NeRF using the existing VPR dataset. Then, our devised self-supervised uncertainty estimation network identifies places with high uncertainty. The poses of these uncertain places are input into NeRF to generate new synthetic observations for further training of VPR networks. Additionally, we propose an improved storage method for efficient organization of augmented and original training data. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets and tested three different VPR backbone networks. The results demonstrate that our proposed training paradigm significantly improves VPR performance by fully utilizing existing data, outperforming other training approaches. We further validated the effectiveness of our approach on self-recorded indoor and outdoor datasets, consistently demonstrating superior results.

Our paper highlights three advancements for SNNs in Visual Place Recognition (VPR). Firstly, we propose Modular SNNs, where each SNN represents a set of non-overlapping geographically distinct places, enabling scalable networks for large environments. Secondly, we present Ensembles of Modular SNNs, where multiple networks represent the same place, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to single-network models. Each of our Modular SNN modules is compact, comprising only 1500 neurons and 474k synapses, making them ideally suited for ensembling due to their small size. Lastly, we investigate the role of sequence matching in SNN-based VPR, a technique where consecutive images are used to refine place recognition. We demonstrate competitive performance of our method on a range of datasets, including higher responsiveness to ensembling compared to conventional VPR techniques and higher R@1 improvements with sequence matching than VPR techniques with comparable baseline performance. Our contributions highlight the viability of SNNs for VPR, offering scalable and robust solutions, and paving the way for their application in various energy-sensitive robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO)</p></details> |

Existing visual place recognition (VPR) methods, which typically rely on global descriptors or aggregate local features, often struggle in cluttered indoor environments densely populated with man-made objects. These methods tend to overlook the crucial role of object-oriented information. To address this, we propose AirRoom, an object-aware pipeline that integrates multi-level object-oriented information-from global context to object patches, object segmentation, and keypoints-utilizing a coarse-to-fine retrieval approach. Extensive experiments on four newly constructed datasets-MPReID, HMReID, GibsonReID, and ReplicaReID-demonstrate that AirRoom outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across nearly all evaluation metrics, with improvements ranging from 6% to 80%. Moreover, AirRoom exhibits significant flexibility, allowing various modules within the pipeline to be substituted with different alternatives without compromising overall performance.

To identify the exact location in an image, detecting landmarks is crucial. However, in some scenarios, such as urban environments, there are numerous landmarks, such as various modern buildings, and the landmarks in different cities often exhibit high visual similarity. Therefore, it is essential not only to leverage the landmarks but also to consider the contextual information surrounding them, such as whether there are trees, roads, or other features around the landmarks. We propose the Contextual Query VPR (CQVPR), which integrates contextual information with detailed pixel-level visual features. By leveraging a set of learnable contextual queries, our method automatically learns the high-level contexts with respect to landmarks and their surrounding areas. Heatmaps depicting regions that each query attends to serve as context-aware features, offering cues that could enhance the understanding of each scene. We further propose a query matching loss to supervise the extraction process of contextual queries. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional visual place recognition (VPR) methods rely solely on single-view visual information and cannot interpret human language descriptions. To overcome this challenge, we bridge text and vision by proposing a multiview (360{\deg} views of the surroundings) text-vision registration approach called Text4VPR for place recognition task, which is the first method that exclusively utilizes textual descriptions to match a database of images. Text4VPR employs the frozen T5 language model to extract global textual embeddings. Additionally, it utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm with temperature coefficient to assign local tokens to their respective clusters, thereby aggregating visual descriptors from images. During the training stage, Text4VPR emphasizes the alignment between individual text-image pairs for precise textual description. In the inference stage, Text4VPR uses the Cascaded Cross-Attention Cosine Alignment (CCCA) to address the internal mismatch between text and image groups. Subsequently, Text4VPR performs precisely place match based on the descriptions of text-image groups. On Street360Loc, the first text to image VPR dataset we created, Text4VPR builds a robust baseline, achieving a leading top-1 accuracy of 57% and a leading top-10 accuracy of 92% within a 5-meter radius on the test set, which indicates that localization from textual descriptions to images is not only feasible but also holds significant potential for further advancement, as shown in Figure 1.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, automating underwater ecosystem management with robotic platforms remains challenging due to the complexities of underwater imagery, which pose significant difficulties for traditional visual localization methods. We propose an integrated pipeline that combines Visual Place Recognition (VPR), feature matching, and image segmentation on video-derived images. This method enables robust identification of revisited areas, estimation of rigid transformations, and downstream analysis of ecosystem changes. Furthermore, we introduce the SQUIDLE+ VPR Benchmark-the first large-scale underwater VPR benchmark designed to leverage an extensive collection of unstructured data from multiple robotic platforms, spanning time intervals from days to years.

Although Vision Transformer (ViT) solutions deliver high accuracy, their large models often exceed the memory and compute budgets of resource-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile robots. To address this issue, we propose TeTRA, a ternary transformer approach that progressively quantizes the ViT backbone to 2-bit precision and binarizes its final embedding layer, offering substantial reductions in model size and latency. A carefully designed progressive distillation strategy preserves the representational power of a full-precision teacher, allowing TeTRA to retain or even surpass the accuracy of uncompressed convolutional counterparts, despite using fewer resources. Experiments on standard VPR benchmarks demonstrate that TeTRA reduces memory consumption by up to 69% compared to efficient baselines, while lowering inference latency by 35%, with either no loss or a slight improvement in recall@1. These gains enable high-accuracy VPR on power-constrained, memory-limited robotic platforms, making TeTRA an appealing solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CL methods often focus on knowledge transfer from a known model to a new one, overlooking the existence of unknown black-box models. We explore a novel multi-robot CL approach that enables knowledge transfer from black-box VPR models (teachers), such as those of local robots encountered by traveler robots (students) in unknown environments. Specifically, we introduce Membership Inference Attack, or MIA, the only major privacy attack applicable to black-box models, and leverage it to reconstruct pseudo training sets, which serve as the key knowledge to be exchanged between robots, from black-box VPR models. Furthermore, we aim to overcome the inherently low sampling efficiency of MIA by leveraging insights on place class prediction distribution and un-learned class detection imported from the VPR literature as a prior distribution. We also analyze both the individual effects of these methods and their combined impact. Experimental results demonstrate that our black-box MIA (BB-MIA) approach is remarkably powerful despite its simplicity, significantly enhancing the VPR capability of lower-performing robots through brief communication with other robots. This study contributes to optimizing knowledge sharing between robots in VPR and enhancing autonomy in open-world environments with multi-robot systems that are fault-tolerant and scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> |

The pair classifier can predict whether a given pair of images are from the same place or not. The network only comprises Vision Transformer components for both the encoder and the pair classifier, and both components are trained using their respective class tokens. In existing VPR methods, typically the network is initialized using pre-trained weights from a generic image dataset such as ImageNet. In this work we propose an alternative pre-training strategy, by using Siamese Masked Image Modelling as a pre-training task. We propose a Place-aware image sampling procedure from a collection of large VPR datasets for pre-training our model, to learn visual features tuned specifically for VPR. By re-using the Mask Image Modelling encoder and decoder weights in the second stage of training, Pair-VPR can achieve state-of-the-art VPR performance across five benchmark datasets with a ViT-B encoder, along with further improvements in localization recall with larger encoders.

Compared to single-modal VPR, this approach benefits from the widespread availability of RGB cameras and the robustness of point clouds in providing accurate spatial geometry and distance information. However, current methods rely on intermediate modalities that capture either the vertical or horizontal field of view, limiting their ability to fully exploit the complementary information from both sensors. In this work, we propose an innovative initial retrieval + re-rank method that effectively combines information from range (or RGB) images and Bird's Eye View (BEV) images. Our approach relies solely on a computationally efficient global descriptor similarity search process to achieve re-ranking. Additionally, we introduce a novel similarity label supervision technique to maximize the utility of limited training data. Specifically, we employ points average distance to approximate appearance similarity and incorporate an adaptive margin, based on similarity differences, into the vanilla triplet loss. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art (SOTA) models extract global descriptors using the powerful foundation model DINOv2 as backbone. These models either explore the cross-image correlation or propose a time-consuming two-stage re-ranking strategy to achieve better performance. However, existing works only utilize the final output of DINOv2, and the current cross-image correlation causes unstable retrieval results. To produce both discriminative and constant global descriptors, this paper proposes stable cross-image correlation enhanced model for VPR called SciceVPR. This model explores the full potential of DINOv2 in providing useful feature representations that implicitly encode valuable contextual knowledge. Specifically, SciceVPR first uses a multi-layer feature fusion module to capture increasingly detailed task-relevant channel and spatial information from the multi-layer output of DINOv2. Secondly, SciceVPR considers the invariant correlation between images within a batch as valuable knowledge to be distilled into the proposed self-enhanced encoder. In this way, SciceVPR can acquire fairly robust global features regardless of domain shifts (e.g., changes in illumination, weather and viewpoint between pictures taken in the same place). Experimental results demonstrate that the base variant, SciceVPR-B, outperforms SOTA one-stage methods with single input on multiple datasets with varying domain conditions. The large variant, SciceVPR-L, performs on par with SOTA two-stage models, scoring over 3% higher in Recall@1 compared to existing models on the challenging Tokyo24/7 dataset. Our code will be released at https://github.com/shuimushan/SciceVPR.</p></details> |  |

In our previous work, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of foundation models to VPR (SelaVPR). This method can produce both global and local features that focus on discriminative landmarks to recognize places for two-stage VPR by a parameter-efficient adaptation approach. Although SelaVPR has achieved competitive results, we argue that the previous adaptation is inefficient in training time and GPU memory usage, and the re-ranking paradigm is also costly in retrieval latency and storage usage. In pursuit of higher efficiency and better performance, we propose an extension of the SelaVPR, called SelaVPR++. Concretely, we first design a parameter-, time-, and memory-efficient adaptation method that uses lightweight multi-scale convolution (MultiConv) adapters to refine intermediate features from the frozen foundation backbone. This adaptation method does not back-propagate gradients through the backbone during training, and the MultiConv adapter facilitates feature interactions along the spatial axes and introduces proper local priors, thus achieving higher efficiency and better performance. Moreover, we propose an innovative re-ranking paradigm for more efficient VPR. Instead of relying on local features for re-ranking, which incurs huge overhead in latency and storage, we employ compact binary features for initial retrieval and robust floating-point (global) features for re-ranking. To obtain such binary features, we propose a similarity-constrained deep hashing method, which can be easily integrated into the VPR pipeline. Finally, we improve our training strategy and unify the training protocol of several common training datasets to merge them for better training of VPR models. Extensive experiments show that ......</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring such datasets is time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. To address these limitations, the use of synthetic data has gained attention as a viable alternative, allowing researchers to generate vast amounts of data while simulating various environmental contexts in a controlled setting. In this study, we investigate the use of synthetic data in robotics and navigation, specifically focusing on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR). In particular, we introduce a synthetic dataset created using the virtual environment of the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), along with an algorithm designed to generate a VPR dataset, without human supervision. Through a series of experiments centered on SLAM and VPR, we demonstrate that synthetic data derived from GTA V are qualitatively comparable to real-world data. Furthermore, these synthetic data can complement or even substitute real-world data in these applications. This study sets the stage for the creation of large-scale synthetic datasets, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for future research and development.</p></details> |  |

It enables the systems to robustly localize themselves in large-scale environments. Existing VPR methods demonstrate attractive performance at the cost of heavy pre-training and limited generalizability. When deployed in unseen environments, these methods exhibit significant performance drops. Targeting this issue, we present VIPeR, a novel approach for visual incremental place recognition with the ability to adapt to new environments while retaining the performance of previous environments. We first introduce an adaptive mining strategy that balances the performance within a single environment and the generalizability across multiple environments. Then, to prevent catastrophic forgetting in lifelong learning, we draw inspiration from human memory systems and design a novel memory bank for our VIPeR. Our memory bank contains a sensory memory, a working memory and a long-term memory, with the first two focusing on the current environment and the last one for all previously visited environments. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic knowledge distillation to explicitly safeguard the previously learned knowledge. We evaluate our proposed VIPeR on three large-scale datasets, namely Oxford Robotcar, Nordland, and TartanAir. For comparison, we first set a baseline performance with naive finetuning. Then, several more recent lifelong learning methods are compared. Our VIPeR achieves better performance in almost all aspects with the biggest improvement of 13.65% in average performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Learning Street View Representations with Spatiotemporal Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04638v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street view imagery is extensively utilized in representation learning for urban visual environments, supporting various sustainable development tasks such as environmental perception and socio-economic assessment. However, it is challenging for existing image representations to specifically encode the dynamic urban environment (such as pedestrians, vehicles, and vegetation), the built environment (including buildings, roads, and urban infrastructure), and the environmental ambiance (such as the cultural and socioeconomic atmosphere) depicted in street view imagery to address downstream tasks related to the city. In this work, we propose an innovative self-supervised learning framework that leverages temporal and spatial attributes of street view imagery to learn image representations of the dynamic urban environment for diverse downstream tasks. By employing street view images captured at the same location over time and spatially nearby views at the same time, we construct contrastive learning tasks designed to learn the temporal-invariant characteristics of the built environment and the spatial-invariant neighborhood ambiance. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional supervised and unsupervised methods in tasks such as visual place recognition, socioeconomic estimation, and human-environment perception. Moreover, we demonstrate the varying behaviors of image representations learned through different contrastive learning objectives across various downstream tasks. This study systematically discusses representation learning strategies for urban studies based on street view images, providing a benchmark that enhances the applicability of visual data in urban science.

We propose a strategy to align the input sensor modalities by leveraging stereo image streams to produce metric depth predictions with pose information, followed by fusing multiple scene views from a local window using a probabilistic occupancy framework to expand the limited field-of-view of the camera. Additionally, SOLVR adopts a flexible definition of what constitutes positive examples for different training losses, allowing us to simultaneously optimise place recognition and registration performance. Furthermore, we replace RANSAC with a registration function that weights a simple least-squares fitting with the estimated inlier likelihood of sparse keypoint correspondences, improving performance in scenarios with a low inlier ratio between the query and retrieved place. Our experiments on the KITTI and KITTI360 datasets show that SOLVR achieves state-of-the-art performance for LiDAR-Visual place recognition and registration, particularly improving registration accuracy over larger distances between the query and retrieved place.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2025 |
| **[EffoVPR: Effective Foundation Model Utilization for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18065v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on VPR-specific data. In this paper, we present an effective approach to harness the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We show that features extracted from self-attention layers can act as a powerful re-ranker for VPR, even in a zero-shot setting. Our method not only outperforms previous zero-shot approaches but also introduces results competitive with several supervised methods. We then show that a single-stage approach utilizing internal ViT layers for pooling can produce global features that achieve state-of-the-art performance, with impressive feature compactness down to 128D. Moreover, integrating our local foundation features for re-ranking further widens this performance gap. Our method also demonstrates exceptional robustness and generalization, setting new state-of-the-art performance, while handling challenging conditions such as occlusion, day-night transitions, and seasonal variations.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While cost-effective and easily deployed, camera sensors are sensitive to lighting and weather changes, and even slight image alterations can greatly affect VPR efficiency and precision. Existing methods overcome this by exploiting powerful yet large networks, leading to significant consumption of computational resources. In this paper, we propose a high-performance teacher and lightweight student distillation framework called TSCM. It exploits our devised cross-metric knowledge distillation to narrow the performance gap between the teacher and student models, maintaining superior performance while enabling minimal computational load during deployment. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on large-scale datasets, namely Pittsburgh30k and Pittsburgh250k. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline models in terms of recognition accuracy and model parameter efficiency. Moreover, our ablation studies show that the proposed knowledge distillation technique surpasses other counterparts.

| **[Towards Revisiting Visual Place Recognition for Joining Submaps in Multimap SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12408v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual SLAM is a key technology for many autonomous systems. However, tracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging strategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap merging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not sufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall system. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its full potential without requiring substantial interference in the original system. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set of metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We evaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3 with NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple approach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show that the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on these results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches for SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024.

| **[A Visual-inertial Localization Algorithm using Opportunistic Visual Beacons and Dead-Reckoning for GNSS-Denied Large-scale Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19845v2)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of smart cities, the demand for continuous pedestrian navigation in large-scale urban environments has significantly increased. While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVC-VPR: Mutual Learning of Viewpoint Classification and Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09199v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to robustly identify locations by leveraging image retrieval based on descriptors encoded from environmental images. However, drastic appearance changes of images captured from different viewpoints at the same location pose incoherent supervision signals for descriptor learning, which severely hinder the performance of VPR. Previous work proposes classifying images based on manually defined rules or ground truth labels for viewpoints, followed by descriptor training based on the classification results. However, not all datasets have ground truth labels of viewpoints and manually defined rules may be suboptimal, leading to degraded descriptor performance.To address these challenges, we introduce the mutual learning of viewpoint self-classification and VPR. Starting from coarse classification based on geographical coordinates, we progress to finer classification of viewpoints using simple clustering techniques. The dataset is partitioned in an unsupervised manner while simultaneously training a descriptor extractor for place recognition. Experimental results show that this approach almost perfectly partitions the dataset based on viewpoints, thus achieving mutually reinforcing effects. Our method even excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that partition datasets using ground truth labels.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[On Motion Blur and Deblurring in Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07751v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in mobile robotics enables robots to localize themselves by recognizing previously visited locations using visual data. While the reliability of VPR methods has been extensively studied under conditions such as changes in illumination, season, weather and viewpoint, the impact of motion blur is relatively unexplored despite its relevance not only in rapid motion scenarios but also in low-light conditions where longer exposure times are necessary. Similarly, the role of image deblurring in enhancing VPR performance under motion blur has received limited attention so far. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing a new benchmark designed to evaluate VPR performance under the influence of motion blur and image deblurring. The benchmark includes three datasets that encompass a wide range of motion blur intensities, providing a comprehensive platform for analysis. Experimental results with several well-established VPR and image deblurring methods provide new insights into the effects of motion blur and the potential improvements achieved through deblurring. Building on these findings, the paper proposes adaptive deblurring strategies for VPR, designed to effectively manage motion blur in dynamic, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing reviews predominantly concentrate on visual place recognition (VPR) methods. Despite the recent remarkable progress in LPR, to the best of our knowledge, there is no dedicated systematic review in this area. This paper bridges the gap by providing a comprehensive review of place recognition methods employing LiDAR sensors, thus facilitating and encouraging further research. We commence by delving into the problem formulation of place recognition, exploring existing challenges, and describing relations to previous surveys. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth review of related research, which offers detailed classifications, strengths and weaknesses, and architectures. Finally, we summarize existing datasets, commonly used evaluation metrics, and comprehensive evaluation results from various methods on public datasets. This paper can serve as a valuable tutorial for newcomers entering the field of place recognition and for researchers interested in long-term robot localization.

| **[Distillation of Diffusion Features for Semantic Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03512v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic correspondence, the task of determining relationships between different parts of images, underpins various applications including 3D reconstruction, image-to-image translation, object tracking, and visual place recognition. Recent studies have begun to explore representations learned in large generative image models for semantic correspondence, demonstrating promising results. Building on this progress, current state-of-the-art methods rely on combining multiple large models, resulting in high computational demands and reduced efficiency. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a more computationally efficient approach. We propose a novel knowledge distillation technique to overcome the problem of reduced efficiency. We show how to use two large vision foundation models and distill the capabilities of these complementary models into one smaller model that maintains high accuracy at reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by incorporating 3D data, we are able to further improve performance, without the need for human-annotated correspondences. Overall, our empirical results demonstrate that our distilled model with 3D data augmentation achieves performance superior to current state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational load and enhancing practicality for real-world applications, such as semantic video correspondence.

We propose a novel visual place recognition approach based on overlap prediction, called VOP, shifting from traditional reliance on global image similarities and local features to image overlap prediction. VOP proceeds co-visible image sections by obtaining patch-level embeddings using a Vision Transformer backbone and establishing patch-to-patch correspondences without requiring expensive feature detection and matching. Our approach uses a voting mechanism to assess overlap scores for potential database images. It provides a nuanced image retrieval metric in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that VOP leads to more accurate relative pose estimation and localization results on the retrieved image pairs than state-of-the-art baselines on a number of large-scale, real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/weitong8591/vop.git.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |
| **[Multiview Scene Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11187v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A proper scene representation is central to the pursuit of spatial intelligence where agents can robustly reconstruct and efficiently understand 3D scenes. A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM. In this work, we propose to build Multiview Scene Graphs (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes. The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes. To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset. We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges. Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Self-Supervised Place Recognition by Refining Temporal and Featural Pseudo Labels from Panoramic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09315v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) using deep networks has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, most of them require a training set with ground truth sensor poses to obtain positive and negative samples of each observation's spatial neighborhood for supervised learning. When such information is unavailable, temporal neighborhoods from a sequentially collected data stream could be exploited for self-supervised training, although we find its performance suboptimal. Inspired by noisy label learning, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TF-VPR that uses temporal neighborhoods and learnable feature neighborhoods to discover unknown spatial neighborhoods. Our method follows an iterative training paradigm which alternates between: (1) representation learning with data augmentation, (2) positive set expansion to include the current feature space neighbors, and (3) positive set contraction via geometric verification. We conduct auto-labeling and generalization tests on both simulated and real datasets, with either RGB images or point clouds as inputs. The results show that our method outperforms self-supervised baselines in recall rate, robustness, and heading diversity, a novel metric we propose for VPR. Our code and datasets can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/TF-VPR/</p></details> |  |

Previously, SVM classifiers have been used to monitor VPR integrity. This research introduces a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) integrity monitor which demonstrates improved performance and generalizability, removing per-environment training and reducing manual tuning requirements. We test our proposed system in extensive real-world experiments, presenting two real-time integrity-based VPR verification methods: a single-query rejection method for robot navigation to a goal zone (Experiment 1); and a history-of-queries method that takes a best, verified, match from its recent trajectory and uses an odometer to extrapolate a current position estimate (Experiment 2). Noteworthy results for Experiment 1 include a decrease in aggregate mean along-track goal error from ~9.8m to ~3.1m, and an increase in the aggregate rate of successful mission completion from ~41% to ~55%. Experiment 2 showed a decrease in aggregate mean along-track localization error from ~2.0m to ~0.5m, and an increase in the aggregate localization precision from ~97% to ~99%. Overall, our results demonstrate the practical usefulness of a VPR integrity monitor in real-world robotics to improve VPR localization and consequent navigation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Preprint for Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a new technique, called Bag-of-Queries (BoQ), which learns a set of global queries designed to capture universal place-specific attributes. Unlike existing methods that employ self-attention and generate the queries directly from the input features, BoQ employs distinct learnable global queries, which probe the input features via cross-attention, ensuring consistent information aggregation. In addition, our technique provides an interpretable attention mechanism and integrates with both CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. The performance of BoQ is demonstrated through extensive experiments on 14 large-scale benchmarks. It consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques including NetVLAD, MixVPR and EigenPlaces. Moreover, as a global retrieval technique (one-stage), BoQ surpasses two-stage retrieval methods, such as Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR and R2Former, all while being orders of magnitude faster and more efficient.

While Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are the standard default solution for solving the aerial localization problem, it is subject to a number of limitations, such as, signal instability or solution unreliability that make this option not so desirable. Consequently, visual geolocalization is emerging as a viable alternative. However, adapting Visual Place Recognition (VPR) task to aerial imagery presents significant challenges, including weather variations and repetitive patterns. Current VPR reviews largely neglect the specific context of aerial data. This paper introduces a methodology tailored for evaluating VPR techniques specifically in the domain of aerial imagery, providing a comprehensive assessment of various methods and their performance. However, we not only compare various VPR methods, but also demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate zoom and overlap levels when constructing map tiles to achieve maximum efficiency of VPR algorithms in the case of aerial imagery.

VPR faces challenges such as accurate image neighbor retrieval and appearance change in scenery. Event cameras, also known as dynamic vision sensors, are a new sensor modality for VPR and offer a promising solution to the challenges with their unique attributes: high temporal resolution (1MHz clock), ultra-low latency (in {\mu}s), and high dynamic range (>120dB). These attributes make event cameras less susceptible to motion blur and more robust in variable lighting conditions, making them suitable for addressing VPR challenges. However, the scarcity of event-based VPR datasets, partly due to the novelty and cost of event cameras, hampers their adoption. To fill this data gap, our paper introduces the NYC-Event-VPR dataset to the robotics and computer vision communities, featuring the Prophesee IMX636 HD event sensor (1280x720 resolution), combined with RGB camera and GPS module. It encompasses over 13 hours of geotagged event data, spanning 260 kilometers across New York City, covering diverse lighting and weather conditions, day/night scenarios, and multiple visits to various locations. Furthermore, our paper employs three frameworks to conduct generalization performance assessments, promoting innovation in event-based VPR and its integration into robotics applications.</p></details> |  |

Model-free approaches compute the image pair similarity based on a spatial comparison of corresponding local visual features, eliminating the need for computationally expensive estimation of a model describing transformation between images. The article focuses on model-free re-ranking based on standard local visual features and their applicability in long-term autonomy systems. It introduces three new model-free re-ranking methods that were designed primarily for deep-learned local visual features. These features evince high robustness to various appearance changes, which stands as a crucial property for use with long-term autonomy systems. All the introduced methods were employed in a new visual place recognition system together with the D2-net feature detector (Dusmanu, 2019) and experimentally tested with diverse, challenging public datasets. The obtained results are on par with current state-of-the-art methods, affirming that model-free approaches are a viable and worthwhile path for long-term visual place recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (Early Access)</p></details> |
| **[Context-Based Visual-Language Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19341v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vision-based robot localization and SLAM, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is essential. This paper addresses the problem of VPR, which involves accurately recognizing the location corresponding to a given query image. A popular approach to vision-based place recognition relies on low-level visual features. Despite significant progress in recent years, place recognition based on low-level visual features is challenging when there are changes in scene appearance. To address this, end-to-end training approaches have been proposed to overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. However, these approaches still fail under drastic changes and require large amounts of labeled data to train models, presenting a significant limitation. Methods that leverage high-level semantic information, such as objects or categories, have been proposed to handle variations in appearance. In this paper, we introduce a novel VPR approach that remains robust to scene changes and does not require additional training. Our method constructs semantic image descriptors by extracting pixel-level embeddings using a zero-shot, language-driven semantic segmentation model. We validate our approach in challenging place recognition scenarios using real-world public dataset. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms non-learned image representation techniques and off-the-shelf convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptors.

| **[Monocular Visual Place Recognition in LiDAR Maps via Cross-Modal State Space Model and Multi-View Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06285v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving monocular camera localization within pre-built LiDAR maps can bypass the simultaneous mapping process of visual SLAM systems, potentially reducing the computational overhead of autonomous localization. To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAD-BuFF: Burst-aware Fast Feature Aggregation for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19293v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial component of many visual localization pipelines for embodied agents. VPR is often formulated as an image retrieval task aimed at jointly learning local features and an aggregation method. The current state-of-the-art VPR methods rely on VLAD aggregation, which can be trained to learn a weighted contribution of features through their soft assignment to cluster centers. However, this process has two key limitations. Firstly, the feature-to-cluster weighting does not account for over-represented repetitive structures within a cluster, e.g., shadows or window panes; this phenomenon is also referred to as the `burstiness' problem, classically solved by discounting repetitive features before aggregation. Secondly, feature to cluster comparisons are compute-intensive for state-of-the-art image encoders with high-dimensional local features. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing VLAD-BuFF with two novel contributions: i) a self-similarity based feature discounting mechanism to learn Burst-aware features within end-to-end VPR training, and ii) Fast Feature aggregation by reducing local feature dimensions specifically through PCA-initialized learnable pre-projection. We benchmark our method on 9 public datasets, where VLAD-BuFF sets a new state of the art. Our method is able to maintain its high recall even for 12x reduced local feature dimensions, thus enabling fast feature aggregation without compromising on recall. Through additional qualitative studies, we show how our proposed weighting method effectively downweights the non-distinctive features.

| **[Revisit Anything: Visual Place Recognition via Image Segment Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18049v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately recognizing a revisited place is crucial for embodied agents to localize and navigate. This requires visual representations to be distinct, despite strong variations in camera viewpoint and scene appearance. Existing visual place recognition pipelines encode the "whole" image and search for matches. This poses a fundamental challenge in matching two images of the same place captured from different camera viewpoints: "the similarity of what overlaps can be dominated by the dissimilarity of what does not overlap". We address this by encoding and searching for "image segments" instead of the whole images. We propose to use open-set image segmentation to decompose an image into `meaningful' entities (i.e., things and stuff). This enables us to create a novel image representation as a collection of multiple overlapping subgraphs connecting a segment with its neighboring segments, dubbed SuperSegment. Furthermore, to efficiently encode these SuperSegments into compact vector representations, we propose a novel factorized representation of feature aggregation. We show that retrieving these partial representations leads to significantly higher recognition recall than the typical whole image based retrieval. Our segments-based approach, dubbed SegVLAD, sets a new state-of-the-art in place recognition on a diverse selection of benchmark datasets, while being applicable to both generic and task-specialized image encoders. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to ``revisit anything'' by evaluating our method on an object instance retrieval task, which bridges the two disparate areas of research: visual place recognition and object-goal navigation, through their common aim of recognizing goal objects specific to a place.

While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Pruning for Efficient Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07834v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is fundamental for the global re-localization of robots and devices, enabling them to recognize previously visited locations based on visual inputs. This capability is crucial for maintaining accurate mapping and localization over large areas. Given that VPR methods need to operate in real-time on embedded systems, it is critical to optimize these systems for minimal resource consumption. While the most efficient VPR approaches employ standard convolutional backbones with fixed descriptor dimensions, these often lead to redundancy in the embedding space as well as in the network architecture. Our work introduces a novel structured pruning method, to not only streamline common VPR architectures but also to strategically remove redundancies within the feature embedding space. This dual focus significantly enhances the efficiency of the system, reducing both map and model memory requirements and decreasing feature extraction and retrieval latencies. Our approach has reduced memory usage and latency by 21% and 16%, respectively, across models, while minimally impacting recall@1 accuracy by less than 1%. This significant improvement enhances real-time applications on edge devices with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> |  |

Unlike visual place recognition (VPR), LiDAR place recognition (LPR) is tolerant to changes in lighting, seasons, and textures, leading to high performance on benchmark datasets from structured urban environments. However, there is a growing need for methods that can operate in diverse environments with high performance and minimal training. In this paper, we propose a handcrafted matching strategy that performs roto-translation invariant place recognition and relative pose estimation for both urban and unstructured natural environments. Our approach constructs Birds Eye View (BEV) global descriptors and employs a two-stage search using matched filtering -- a signal processing technique for detecting known signals amidst noise. Extensive testing on the NCLT, Oxford Radar, and WildPlaces datasets consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across place recognition and relative pose estimation metrics, with up to 15% higher recall than previous SoTA.</p></details> |  |

| **[Raindrop GS: A Benchmark for 3D Gaussian Splatting under Raindrop Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17719v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware 3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Initialize to Generalize: A Stronger Initialization Pipeline for Sparse-View 3DGS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17479v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints (regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i) frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points, compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii) point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a stronger initialization strategy.

However, the noisy and sparse nature of the returned scan data proves to be a challenging obstacle for existing registration algorithms, especially those originally intended for more accurate sensors such as LiDAR. Following the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting for vision, in this paper we propose a summarized representation for radar scenes based on global simultaneous optimization of 3D Gaussians as opposed to voxel-based approaches, and leveraging its inherent probability distribution function for registration. Moreover, we propose tackling the problem of radar noise by optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, following existing practice we implement an Extended Kalman Filter-based Radar-Inertial Odometry pipeline in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. Experiments using publicly available 4D radar datasets show that our Gaussian approach is comparable to existing registration algorithms, outperforming them in several sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and results can be publicly accessed at: https://github.com/robotics-upo/gaussian-rio-cpp</p></details> |
| **[2DGS-R: Revisiting the Normal Consistency Regularization in 2D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16837v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance, leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGC-Avatar: Hierarchical Gaussian Compression for Streamable Dynamic 3D Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16463v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast, photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission, the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual quality and compression efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM I...</summary><p>ACM International Conference on Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[REALM: An MLLM-Agent Framework for Open World 3D Reasoning Segmentation and Editing on Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16410v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization, aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal, replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and versatility.

| **[Geometry and Perception Guided Gaussians for Multiview-consistent 3D Generation from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21152v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail. To tackle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly integrates geometry and perception information without requiring additional model training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically, we incorporate geometry and perception priors to initialize the Gaussian branches and guide their parameter optimization. The geometry prior captures the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we introduce a stable Score Distillation Sampling for fine-grained prior distillation to ensure effective knowledge transfer. The model is further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth consistency. Experimental results show that we outperform existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Low-Frequency First: Eliminating Floating Artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02493v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS), which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion, effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of 1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks.

However, most existing methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures. Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy. PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.</p></details> |  |

This enables unprecedented speed -- exceeding 100,000 steps per second on consumer GPUs -- while maintaining high visual fidelity, which we showcase across diverse tasks. We additionally demonstrate its applicability in a sim-to-real robotics setting. Beyond depth-based sensing, our results highlight how rich visual semantics improve navigation and decision-making, such as avoiding undesirable regions. We further showcase the ease of incorporating thousands of environments from iPhone scans, large-scale scene datasets (e.g., GrandTour, ARKit), and outputs from generative video models like Veo, enabling rapid creation of realistic training worlds.

However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives densification caused by motion blur. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D scenes from motion-blurred images. BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions. Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further corrects motion-induced blur distortions. To alleviate multi-subframe gradient conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both stages. Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority over the state of the arts.Our source code is available at https://github.com/wsxujm/bsgs</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

In particular, directly generating explicit 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gynjn.github.io/iLRM/</p></details> |

However, existing methods often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction. To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90% redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization, our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation, demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction.

Despite the impressive storage reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful representational capacity of learned image priors to recover compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop on ECLR</p></details> |

The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting. Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting. To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in shared memory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible quality degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASP-DAC 2026</p></details> |

While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data. In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges 2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details. We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes. Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches, highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either approach alone.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, our HuGDiffusion shows significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging 2D Priors and SDF Guidance for Dynamic Urban Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13381v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories, without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene composition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV-2025, project page: https://dynamic-ugsdf.github.io/</p></details> |

Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images, geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers, enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm. Source code and multimodal viewer will be available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ev4DGS: Novel-view Rendering of Non-Rigid Objects from Monocular Event Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11717v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only. This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS, i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images) from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/Ev4DGS/.</p></details> |  |

While reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution, Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23% in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and interaction information is essential for success. Project website: https://phys2real.github.io/ .</p></details> |  |
| **[VA-GS: Enhancing the Geometric Representation of Gaussian Splatting via View Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11473v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment. In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable, high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible, articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures (e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks. Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Towards Efficient 3D Gaussian Human Avatar Compression: A Prior-Guided Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10492v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations. This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy, enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters, consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[TC-GS: A Faster Gaussian Splatting Module Utilizing Tensor Cores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24796v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) renders pixels by rasterizing Gaussian primitives, where conditional alpha-blending dominates the computational cost in the rendering pipeline. This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent universal module that expands the applicability of Tensor Core (TCU) for 3DGS, leading to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing top-tier acceleration algorithms and integrates seamlessly with rendering pipeline designs, such as Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thereby achieving a total acceleration of up to 5.6x.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Gesplat: Robust Pose-Free 3D Reconstruction via Geometry-Guided Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10097v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[P-4DGS: Predictive 4D Gaussian Splatting with 90$\times$ Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10030v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance, especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this, we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to \textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and real-world scenes, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLoD-GS: Continuous Level-of-Detail via 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09997v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Powered Code Analysis and Optimization for Gaussian Splatting Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25626v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Given its importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However, with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and 24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand, even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations, Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts. This highlights the potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs.</p></details> | Updated Figure 12 |

Failing to promptly update the changed regions can degrade map quality, resulting in poor localization, inefficient operations, and even lost robots. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently seen widespread adoption in online map reconstruction due to its dense, differentiable, and photorealistic properties, yet accurately and efficiently updating the regions of change remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose VG-Mapping, a novel online 3DGS-based mapping system tailored for such semi-static scenes. Our approach introduces a hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with a TSDF-based voxel map to efficiently identify changed regions in a scene, along with a variation-aware density control strategy that inserts or deletes Gaussian primitives in regions undergoing change. Furthermore, to address the absence of public benchmarks for this task, we construct a RGB-D dataset comprising both synthetic and real-world semi-static environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves the rendering quality and map update efficiency in semi-static scenes.

Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, pose-free observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of large complex scenes (with high degree of foreground and background detail) with known camera poses using view-conditioned generative priors, these methods cannot be directly adapted for the pose-free setting when ground-truth poses are not available during evaluation. To address this, we propose an image-to-image generative model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We introduce context and geometry conditioning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation layers as a lightweight alternative to cross-attention and also propose a novel confidence measure for 3D Gaussian splat representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent 3D representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 and DL3DV-10K benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed (precomputed camera parameters are given) reconstruction methods in complex 360 scenes.

| **[Visibility-Aware Densification for 3D Gaussian Splatting in Dynamic Urban Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09364v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically, achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS, comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions.

| **[Splat the Net: Radiance Fields with Splattable Neural Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08491v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power. Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$ fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or adaptation frameworks.

While state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods excel at synthesizing photorealistic novel views through rasterization-based rendering, their reliance on sparse, explicit primitives severely limits their ability to recover watertight and topologically consistent 3D surfaces.We introduce MonoGSDF, a novel method that couples Gaussian-based primitives with a neural Signed Distance Field (SDF) for high-quality reconstruction. During training, the SDF guides Gaussians' spatial distribution, while at inference, Gaussians serve as priors to reconstruct surfaces, eliminating the need for memory-intensive Marching Cubes. To handle arbitrary-scale scenes, we propose a scaling strategy for robust generalization. A multi-resolution training scheme further refines details and monocular geometric cues from off-the-shelf estimators enhance reconstruction quality. Experiments on real-world datasets show MonoGSDF outperforms prior methods while maintaining efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Manual annotation is costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two 3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing. Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VCIP 2025 (International Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing 2025)</p></details> |

These artifacts, manifesting as flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing ``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEGS: Deformable Event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting from RGB and Event Stream](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07752v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively, the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS with the help of event data.</p></details> | Accepted by TVCG |

Addressing this, we identify notable redundancies across the SLAM pipeline for acceleration. While conceptually straightforward, practical approaches are required to minimize the overhead associated with identifying and eliminating these redundancies. In response, we propose RTGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that comprehensively reduces the redundancies for real-time 3DGS-SLAM on edge. To minimize the overhead, RTGS fully leverages the characteristics of the 3DGS-SLAM pipeline. On the algorithm side, we introduce (1) an adaptive Gaussian pruning step to remove the redundant Gaussians by reusing gradients computed during backpropagation; and (2) a dynamic downsampling technique that directly reuses the keyframe identification and alpha computing steps to eliminate redundant pixels. On the hardware side, we propose (1) a subtile-level streaming strategy and a pixel-level pairwise scheduling strategy that mitigates workload imbalance via a Workload Scheduling Unit (WSU) guided by previous iteration information; (2) a Rendering and Backpropagation (R&B) Buffer that accelerates the rendering backpropagation by reusing intermediate data computed during rendering; and (3) a Gradient Merging Unit (GMU) to reduce intensive memory accesses caused by atomic operations while enabling pipelined aggregation. Integrated into an edge GPU, RTGS achieves real-time performance (>= 30 FPS) on four datasets and three algorithms, with up to 82.5x energy efficiency over the baseline and negligible quality loss.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers real-time, high-fidelity rendering, its performance drastically deteriorates under sparse inputs, plagued by floating artifacts and structural failures. To address these challenges, we introduce HBSplat, a unified framework that elevates 3DGS by seamlessly integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our core contributions are threefold: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that ensures multi-view consistency by leveraging dense matching priors and integrating reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method that enforces substantially stronger constraints by creating high-fidelity virtual views through bidirectional depth-image warping and multi-view fusion; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that recovers occluded areas using a depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model. Extensive evaluations on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks validate that HBSplat sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while maintaining real-time inference.

However, the intricate electromagnetic scattering mechanisms inherent to SAR imaging pose significant reconstruction challenges. Inspired by the remarkable success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) in optical domain reconstruction, this paper presents a novel SAR Differentiable Gaussian Splatting Rasterizer (SDGR) specifically designed for SAR target reconstruction. Our approach combines Gaussian splatting with the Mapping and Projection Algorithm to compute scattering intensities of Gaussian primitives and generate simulated SAR images through SDGR. Subsequently, the loss function between the rendered image and the ground truth image is computed to optimize the Gaussian primitive parameters representing the scene, while a custom CUDA gradient flow is employed to replace automatic differentiation for accelerated gradient computation. Through experiments involving the rendering of simplified architectural targets and SAR images of multiple vehicle targets, we validate the imaging rationality of SDGR on simulated SAR imagery. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method for target reconstruction is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets containing multiple vehicle targets, with quantitative evaluations conducted to assess its reconstruction performance. Experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively reconstruct the geometric structures and scattering properties of targets, thereby providing a novel solution for 3D reconstruction in the field of SAR imaging.</p></details> |  |

We propose SCas4D, a cascaded optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2025)</p></details> |

While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VCIP 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data, which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions, frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose \modelname{}, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while achieving high efficiency.

In this work, we present a unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExGS: Extreme 3D Gaussian Compression with Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24758v4)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality. We introduce ExGS, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) with GaussPainter for Extreme 3DGS compression. UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas GaussPainter leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over 100X compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering.

| **[ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering. ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining. Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss +7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering speed nearly doubles.</p></details> |  |

Unlike mainstream implicit neural models, 3D GS uses millions of learnable 3D Gaussians for an explicit scene representation. Paired with a differentiable rendering algorithm, this approach achieves real-time rendering and unprecedented editability, making it a potential game-changer for 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research. Through this survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering further exploration and advancement in explicit radiance field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project; Paper list: https://github.com/guikunchen/Awesome3DGS ; Benchmark: https://github.com/guikunchen/3DGS-Benchmarks</p></details> |
| **[TimeFormer: Capturing Temporal Relationships of Deformable 3D Gaussians for Robust Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11941v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Recent methods extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via additional deformation fields and apply explicit constraints like motion flow to guide the deformation. However, they learn motion changes from individual timestamps independently, making it challenging to reconstruct complex scenes, particularly when dealing with violent movement, extreme-shaped geometries, or reflective surfaces. To address the above issue, we design a plug-and-play module called TimeFormer to enable existing deformable 3D Gaussians reconstruction methods with the ability to implicitly model motion patterns from a learning perspective. Specifically, TimeFormer includes a Cross-Temporal Transformer Encoder, which adaptively learns the temporal relationships of deformable 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we propose a two-stream optimization strategy that transfers the motion knowledge learned from TimeFormer to the base stream during the training phase. This allows us to remove TimeFormer during inference, thereby preserving the original rendering speed. Extensive experiments in the multi-view and monocular dynamic scenes validate qualitative and quantitative improvement brought by TimeFormer.

Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our "propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at: https://atakan-topaloglu.github.io/oraclegs/</p></details> |

However, it remains challenging due to complex propagation interactions, including reflection, diffraction, and scattering. State-of-the-art neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods achieve high-fidelity RF data synthesis but are limited by long training times and high inference latency. We introduce GSRF, a framework that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from the optical domain to the RF domain, enabling efficient RF data synthesis. GSRF realizes this adaptation through three key innovations: First, it introduces complex-valued 3D Gaussians with a hybrid Fourier-Legendre basis to model directional and phase-dependent radiance. Second, it employs orthographic splatting for efficient ray-Gaussian intersection identification. Third, it incorporates a complex-valued ray tracing algorithm, executed on RF-customized CUDA kernels and grounded in wavefront propagation principles, to synthesize RF data in real time. Evaluated across various RF technologies, GSRF preserves high-fidelity RF data synthesis while achieving significant improvements in training efficiency, shorter training time, and reduced inference latency.</p></details> |  |

SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label 872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests, SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task completion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/sixnor/SketchPlan</p></details> |

Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting.

While recent sparse control methods alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity. Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets, replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

We present MCGS-SLAM, the first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation. These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to 48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction, unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

FalconWing couples a lightweight hardware stack (137g airframe with a 9g camera) and offboard computation with a software stack featuring a photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splat (GSplat) simulator for developing and evaluating vision-based controllers. We validate FalconWing on two challenging vision-based aerial case studies. In the leader-follower case study, our best vision-based controller, trained via imitation learning on GSplat-rendered data augmented with domain randomization, achieves 100% tracking success across 3 types of leader maneuvers over 30 trials and shows robustness to leader's appearance shifts in simulation. In the autonomous landing case study, our vision-based controller trained purely in simulation transfers zero-shot to real hardware, achieving an 80% success rate over ten landing trials. We will release hardware designs, GSplat scenes, and dynamics models upon publication to make FalconWing an open-source flight kit for engineering students and research labs.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussianMorphing: Mesh-Guided 3D Gaussians for Semantic-Aware Object Morphing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02034v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling. The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors 3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior 2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by 26.2%.

However, scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i) partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPMAvatar: Learning 3D Gaussian Avatars with Accurate and Robust Physics-Based Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01619v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1) dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation generalizability.

| **[Proxy-GS: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting via Proxy Mesh](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24421v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Beta Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03312v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.

Unlike existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods, which rely on time-conditioned deformation networks and are limited to interpolation within a fixed time window, ODE-GS eliminates timestamp dependency by modeling Gaussian parameter trajectories as continuous-time latent dynamics. Our approach first learns an interpolation model to generate accurate Gaussian trajectories within the observed window, then trains a Transformer encoder to aggregate past trajectories into a latent state evolved via a neural ODE. Finally, numerical integration produces smooth, physically plausible future Gaussian trajectories, enabling rendering at arbitrary future timestamps. On the D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks, ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation performance, improving metrics by 19.8% compared to leading baselines, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent and predict 3D scene dynamics.</p></details> |  |

GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique, ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering significant improvements over traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ResGS: Residual Densification of 3D Gaussian for Efficient Detail Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07494v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has prevailed in novel view synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, it often struggles to capture rich details and complete geometry. Our analysis reveals that the 3D-GS densification operation lacks adaptiveness and faces a dilemma between geometry coverage and detail recovery. To address this, we introduce a novel densification operation, residual split, which adds a downscaled Gaussian as a residual. Our approach is capable of adaptively retrieving details and complementing missing geometry. To further support this method, we propose a pipeline named ResGS. Specifically, we integrate a Gaussian image pyramid for progressive supervision and implement a selection scheme that prioritizes the densification of coarse Gaussians over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality. Consistent performance improvements can be achieved by applying our residual split on various 3D-GS variants, underscoring its versatility and potential for broader application in 3D-GS-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splat Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15372v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating. Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussianLens: Localized High-Resolution Reconstruction via On-Demand Gaussian Densification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25603v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions, preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to $1024\times1024$ resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triangle Splatting+: Differentiable Rendering with Opaque Triangles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25122v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians, enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines, which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training. Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs.

However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

| **[ARGS: Advanced Regularization on Aligning Gaussians over the Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21344v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics. Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering, there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\% to 7.38\%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> |

However, the images rendered by these methods are often plagued by blurring, undermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This limitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering artifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and discards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates two concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient threshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual localization problems in sparse input scenarios, it will be even more necessary to use data generated by NVS to assist the localization task. We design a coarse-to-fine PoI variant using sparse input NVS to solve this problem. Experiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy. It achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its large model size requires efficient compression for storage and transmission. However, compression techniques, especially quantization-based methods, degrade the integrity of existing 3DGS watermarking methods, thus creating the need for a novel methodology that is robust against compression. To ensure reliable watermark detection under compression, we propose a compression-tolerant 3DGS watermarking method that preserves watermark integrity and rendering quality. Our approach utilizes an anchor-based 3DGS, embedding the watermark into anchor attributes, particularly the anchor feature, to enhance security and rendering quality. We also propose a quantization distortion layer that injects quantization noise during training, preserving the watermark after quantization-based compression. Moreover, we employ a frequency-aware anchor growing strategy that enhances rendering quality by effectively identifying Gaussians in high-frequency regions, and an HSV loss to mitigate color artifacts for further rendering quality improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method preserves the watermark even under compression and maintains high rendering quality.</p></details> | 33 pages, 19 figures |

However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage. Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical or impossible.

Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates (DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019 challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps. These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable skin cancer classification model.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 Figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |

While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness, increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes, with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation while remaining lightweight.</p></details> | 13 pages |

This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward robust, cross-domain signature verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Undergraduate thesis (preprint)---submitted to Escola Polit\'ecnica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (POLI/UFRJ).

Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique.

We utilized machine learning (ML) to build the model and deep learning (DL) techniques, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to generate synthetic data samples to enhance the dataset. The initial dataset contained 656 samples, with only four positive cases, prompting the need for data augmentation. A variety of machine learning models, ranging from interpretable data models to black box algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR) achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86. LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 & 0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0) with 0 false positives (specificity: 1.0). These results highlight the models' effectiveness, with GAN playing a key role in generating synthetic data to support suicide prevention modeling efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Muscle Anatomy-aware Geometric Deep Learning for sEMG-based Gesture Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17660v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate decoding of gesture from non-invasive surface electromyography (sEMG) is important for various applications including spatial computing, healthcare, and entertainment, and has been actively pursued by researchers and industry. Majority of sEMG-based gesture decoding algorithms employ deep neural networks that are designed for Euclidean data, and may not be suitable for analyzing multi-dimensional, non-stationary time-series with long-range dependencies such as sEMG. State-of-the-art sEMG-based decoding methods also demonstrate high variability across subjects and sessions, requiring re-calibration and adaptive fine-tuning to boost performance. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes a geometric deep learning model that learns on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and leverages unsupervised domain adaptation to desensitize the model to subjects and sessions. The model captures the features in time and across sensors with multiple kernels, projects the features onto SPD manifold, learns on manifolds and projects back to Euclidean space for classification. It uses a domain-specific batch normalization layer to address variability between sessions, alleviating the need for re-calibration or fine-tuning. Experiments with publicly available benchmark gesture decoding datasets (Ninapro DB6, Flexwear-HD) demonstrate the superior generalizability of the model compared to Euclidean and other SPD-based models in the inter-session scenario, with up to 8.83 and 4.63 points improvement in accuracy, respectively. Detailed analyses reveal that the model extracts muscle-specific information for different tasks and ablation studies highlight the importance of modules introduced in the work. The proposed method pushes the state-of-the-art in sEMG-based gesture recognition and opens new research avenues for manifold-based learning for muscle signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-supervised Pre-training for Mapping of Archaeological Stone Wall in Historic Landscapes Using High-Resolution DEM Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17644v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1) visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains 63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich environments with scarce annotations.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting these models to rare classes or reinforcing their abilities on multiple specialized domains remains essential. While recent methods rely on monolithic adaptation strategies with a single set of weights, we embrace modular deep learning. We introduce DitHub, a framework designed to build and maintain a library of efficient adaptation modules. Inspired by Version Control Systems, DitHub manages expert modules as branches that can be fetched and merged as needed. This modular approach allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of the compositional properties of adaptation modules, marking the first such study in Object Detection. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ODinW-13 benchmark and ODinW-O, a newly introduced benchmark designed to assess class reappearance.

Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612 dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment with a 6.75 ms inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted to IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER) 2025.

This need becomes even more pressing during global health crises that lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to present the usability deep neural decision forest and deep neural decision tree to predict mortality among Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. To this end, We used patient data encompassing Coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis, demographics, health indicators, and occupational risk factors to analyze disease severity and outcomes. The dataset was partitioned using a stratified sampling method, ensuring that 80% was allocated for training and 20% for testing. Nine machine learning and deep learning methods were employed to build predictive models. The models were evaluated across all stages to determine their effectiveness in predicting patient outcomes. Results: Among the models, the deep neural decision forest consistently outperformed others. Results indicated that using only clinical data yielded an accuracy of 80% by deep neural decision forest, demonstrating it as a reliable predictor of patient mortality. Moreover, the results suggest that clinical data alone may be the most accurate diagnostic tool for predicting mortality.</p></details> |  |

Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However, existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module, which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even when trained on limited and noisy data.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does Label Noise Gradient Descent Improve Generalization in the Low SNR Regime?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17526v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the underlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing label noise in gradient-based training.</p></details> | 40 pages |
| **[Mitigating Clever Hans Strategies in Image Classifiers through Generating Counterexamples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17524v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods, such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate CFKD's efficacy across five datasets, spanning synthetic tasks to an industrial application, with particularly strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced spurious correlations. Additionally, we provide an ablation study on the effect of the chosen counterfactual explainer and teacher model, highlighting their impact on robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards geological inference with process-based and deep generative modeling, part 2: inversion of fluvial deposits and latent-space disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17478v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data, especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best leverage them in support of geological interpretation.</p></details> | 52 pages, 42 figures |

However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in real-time wind forecasts (up to 30 minutes lead time). The model exhibits robustness across forecast horizons and different pressure levels, and its predictions for wind fields show superior agreement with ground-based radar wind profiler compared to concurrent European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures; Minor text revisions; Updated the questions, some images in the article, the abstract, and the main text content</p></details> |

We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors. On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of 0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet (F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated seismic detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences</p></details> |

The latter introduce further complexity due to the neuronal computational units and their additional hyperparameters, whose inadequate setting can dramatically impact the final model performance. At the cost of possible reduced generalization capabilities, the most suitable strategy to fully disclose the power of SNNs is to adopt an application-oriented approach and perform extensive HPO experiments. To facilitate these operations, automatic pipelines are fundamental, and their configuration is crucial. In this document, the Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) toolkit is used as reference framework to present one such solution, with a use case example providing evidence of the corresponding results. In addition, a summary of published works employing the presented pipeline is reported as a potential source of insights into application-oriented HPO experiments for SNN prototyping.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that motion vectors from AV1 video codec can serve as a high-quality and computationally efficient substitute for traditional optical flow, a critical but often resource-intensive component in many computer vision pipelines. Our primary contributions are twofold. First, we provide a detailed comparison of motion vectors from both AV1 and HEVC against ground-truth optical flow, establishing their fidelity. In particular we show the impact of encoder settings on motion estimation fidelity and make recommendations about the optimal settings. Second, we show that using these extracted AV1 motion vectors as a "warm-start" for a state-of-the-art deep learning-based optical flow method, RAFT, significantly reduces the time to convergence while achieving comparable accuracy. Specifically, we observe a four-fold speedup in computation time with only a minor trade- off in end-point error. These findings underscore the potential of reusing motion vectors from compressed video as a practical and efficient method for a wide range of motion-aware computer vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted PCS 2025, camera-ready version</p></details> |

Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent, all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density, repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of 0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003 (correct matches).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 7 equations</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies, and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%, with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.</p></details> |  |

Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution for addressing complex real-world time series challenges.

We propose a heuristic post-processing module that aligns predicted keypoints to tooth boundaries using an auxiliary instance segmentation model. An evaluation metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), is proposed to capture keypoint performance in dental imaging domains. Four donor pose estimation models were adapted with fine-tuning for our keypoint problem. Post-processing improved fine-grained localisation, raising average PRCK^{0.05} by +0.028, but reduced coarse performance for PRCK^{0.25} by -0.0523 and PRCK^{0.5} by -0.0345. Orientation estimation shows excellent performance for auxiliary segmentation when filtered with either stage 1 object detection model. Periodontal staging was detected sufficiently, with the best mesial and distal Dice scores of 0.508 and 0.489, while furcation involvement and widened periodontal ligament space tasks remained challenging due to scarce positive samples. Scalability is implied with similar validation and external set performance. The annotation methodology enables stage agnostic training with balanced representation across disease severities for some detection tasks. The PRCK metric provides a domain-specific alternative to generic pose metrics, while the heuristic post-processing module consistently corrected implausible predictions with occasional catastrophic failures. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of clinically interpretable periodontal bone loss assessment, with potential to reduce diagnostic variability and clinician workload.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 tables, 9 figures, 1 equation, journal paper submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |

Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).</p></details> |  |
| **[CReFT-CAD: Boosting Orthographic Projection Reasoning for CAD via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00568v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing. Orthographic projection reasoning underpins the entire CAD workflow, encompassing design, manufacturing, and simulation. However, prevailing deep-learning approaches employ standard 3D reconstruction pipelines as an alternative, which often introduce imprecise dimensions and limit the parametric editability required for CAD workflows. Recently, some researchers adopt vision-language models (VLMs), particularly supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to tackle CAD-related challenges. SFT shows promise but often devolves into pattern memorization, yielding poor out-of-distribution performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce CReFT-CAD, a two-stage fine-tuning paradigm that first employs a curriculum-driven reinforcement learning stage with difficulty-aware rewards to build reasoning ability steadily, and then applies supervised post-tuning to hone instruction following and semantic extraction. Complementing this, we release TriView2CAD, the first large-scale, open-source benchmark for orthographic projection reasoning, comprising 200,000 synthetic and 3,000 real-world orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations and six interoperable data modalities. We benchmark leading VLMs on orthographic projection reasoning and demonstrate that CReFT-CAD substantially improves reasoning accuracy and out-of-distribution generalizability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights for advancing CAD reasoning research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments are consistent with this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, time-inconsistent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures |

We present TopSeg, a topological representation-centric framework that encodes PCG dynamics with multi-scale topological features and decodes them using a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) with an order- and duration-constrained inference step. To evaluate data efficiency and generalization, we train exclusively on PhysioNet 2016 dataset with subject-level subsampling and perform external validation on CirCor dataset. Under matched-capacity decoders, the topological features consistently outperform spectrogram and envelope inputs, with the largest margins at low data budgets; as a full system, TopSeg surpasses representative end-to-end baselines trained on their native inputs under the same budgets while remaining competitive at full data. Ablations at 10% training confirm that all scales contribute and that combining H_0 and H_1 yields more reliable S1/S2 localization and boundary stability. These results indicate that topology-aware representations provide a strong inductive bias for data-efficient, cross-dataset PCG segmentation, supporting practical use when labeled data are limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper has submitted to ICASSP2026</p></details> |
| **[A Single Set of Adversarial Clothes Breaks Multiple Defense Methods in the Physical World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17322v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack. However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over 64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against adversarial clothes. Code is available at: https://github.com/weiz0823/adv-clothes-break-multiple-defenses.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiscale Neural PDE Surrogates for Prediction and Downscaling: Application to Ocean Currents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18067v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography, high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tackl...</summary><p>Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17270v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grey-box methods for system identification combine deep learning with physics-informed constraints, capturing complex dependencies while improving out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, despite the growing importance of floating-base systems such as humanoids and quadrupeds, current grey-box models ignore their specific physical constraints. For instance, the inertia matrix is not only positive definite but also exhibits branch-induced sparsity and input independence. Moreover, the 6x6 composite spatial inertia of the floating base inherits properties of single-rigid-body inertia matrices. As we show, this includes the triangle inequality on the eigenvalues of the composite rotational inertia. To address the lack of physical consistency in deep learning models of floating-base systems, we introduce a parameterization of inertia matrices that satisfies all these constraints. Inspired by Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN), we train neural networks to predict physically plausible inertia matrices that minimize inverse dynamics error under Lagrangian mechanics. For evaluation, we collected and released a dataset on multiple quadrupeds and humanoids. In these experiments, our Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks (FeLaN) achieve highly competitive performance on both simulated and real robots, while providing greater physical interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Prototypical Network with an Attention-based Encoder for Drivers Identification Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17250v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driver identification has become an area of increasing interest in recent years, especially for data- driven applications, because biometric-based technologies may incur privacy issues. This study proposes a deep learning neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers. The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario. The second experiment showed that P-AttEnc, in the 1-shot scenario, can classify unknown drivers with an average accuracy of 65.7%.</p></details> |  |

We develop a formal framework for majority-minority learning tasks, showing how standard training can favor majority groups and produce stereotypical predictors that neglect minority-specific features. Assuming population and variance imbalance, our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) the close proximity between ``full-data'' and stereotypical predictors, (ii) the dominance of a region where training the entire model tends to merely learn the majority traits, and (iii) a lower bound on the additional training required. Our results are illustrated through experiments in deep learning for tabular and image classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Pixels to People: Satellite-Based Mapping and Quantification of Riverbank Erosion and Lost Villages in Bangladesh](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17198v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now, been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset - a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially, this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the International Conference on Data and Applied Analytics (IDAA 2025). 15 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Patch of Invisibility: Naturalistic Physical Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Object Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04238v6)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks on deep learning models have received increased attention in recent years. Work in this area has mostly focused on gradient-based techniques, so-called 'white-box' attacks, where the attacker has access to the targeted model's internal parameters; such an assumption is usually untenable in the real world. Additionally, some attacks use the entire pixel space to fool a given model, which is neither practical nor physical. To accommodate these problems we propose the BBNP algorithm (Black-Box Naturalistic Patch): a direct, black-box, naturalistic, gradient-free method that uses the learned image manifold of a pretrained, generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate naturalistic adversarial patches for object detectors. This method performs model-agnostic black-box naturalistic attacks on object detection models by relying solely on the outputs of the model. Comparing our approach against five models, five black-box and two white-box attacks, we show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming all other tested black-box approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MLCS @ ECML-PKDD 2024</p></details> |
| **[Combining ECG Foundation Model and XGBoost to Predict In-Hospital Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias in AMI Patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17172v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram (ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features , which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC 0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

Classical rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency, efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop of UrbanAI (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Fish Freshness Classification with Incremental Handcrafted Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17145v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective, inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics, histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved 77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached 97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical applications in food quality monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose deep Fr\'echet neural networks (DFNNs), an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting non-Euclidean responses -- which are considered as random objects in a metric space -- from Euclidean predictors. Our method leverages the representation-learning power of deep neural networks (DNNs) to the task of approximating conditional Fr\'echet means of the response given the predictors, the metric-space analogue of conditional expectations, by minimizing a Fr\'echet risk. The framework is highly flexible, accommodating diverse metrics and high-dimensional predictors. We establish a universal approximation theorem for DFNNs, advancing the state-of-the-art of neural network approximation theory to general metric-space-valued responses without making model assumptions or relying on local smoothing. Empirical studies on synthetic distributional and network-valued responses, as well as a real-world application to predicting employment occupational compositions, demonstrate that DFNNs consistently outperform existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Low-precision fixed-point training presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition. Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5% reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.</p></details> |  |

Manual segmentation is variable and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models (3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38 dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71), radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |

Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024) demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This Work has been submitted to Monthly Weather Review.

We address this by deriving explicit second-order expressions for these components, thereby completing the Hessian characterization of full Transformer blocks. Our results generalize prior self-attention analyses and yield estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework for analyzing loss differences to quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full Transformer architecture, this work establishes a new foundation for theoretical and empirical investigations of optimization in large-scale deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 12 figures.

However, these simulations are non-differentiable, forcing researchers to create attacks that do not integrate simulation environmental factors, reducing attack success. To address this limitation, we introduce UNDREAM, the first software framework that bridges the gap between photorealistic simulators and differentiable renderers to enable end-to-end optimization of adversarial perturbations on any 3D objects. UNDREAM enables manipulation of the environment by offering complete control over weather, lighting, backgrounds, camera angles, trajectories, and realistic human and object movements, thereby allowing the creation of diverse scenes. We showcase a wide array of distinct physically plausible adversarial objects that UNDREAM enables researchers to swiftly explore in different configurable environments. This combination of photorealistic simulation and differentiable optimization opens new avenues for advancing research of physical adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods for diffeomorphic image matching are slow due to inefficient implementations and slow convergence due to the ill-conditioned nature of the optimization problem. Deep learning methods offer fast inference but require extensive training time, substantial inference memory, and fail to generalize across long-tailed distributions or diverse image modalities, necessitating costly retraining. We address these challenges by proposing a training-free, GPU-accelerated multi-scale Adaptive Riemannian Optimization algorithm for fast and accurate dense diffeomorphic image matching. FireANTs runs about 2.5x faster than ANTs on a CPU, and upto 1200x faster on a GPU. On a single GPU, FireANTs performs competitively with deep learning methods on inference runtime while consuming upto 10x less memory. FireANTs shows remarkable robustness to a wide variety of matching problems across modalities, species, and organs without any domain-specific training or tuning. Our framework allows hyperparameter grid search studies with significantly less resources and time compared to traditional and deep learning registration algorithms alike.</p></details> |  |

We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL) pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy. Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably, spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability.

Although recent advances in deep learning-based models have enabled automated event detection, their performance is often limited by data scarcity, environmental noise, and class imbalance. To address these challenges, this study introduces a customized Generative Adversarial Network model, STFTSynth, designed particularly for generating short-time Fourier transform spectrograms derived from acoustic event signals. In contrast to augmentation techniques such as MixUp, generative adversarial networks can synthesize high-quality spectrograms that mimic real-world events, enhancing dataset diversity and robustness. The proposed model integrates dense residual blocks for spatial consistency with bidirectional gated recurrent units for temporal dependency modeling. Model performance is evaluated against three baseline generative models using qualitative inspection and quantitative metrics, including Structural Similarity Index Measure, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and Fr\'echet Inception Distance. Results show that STFTSynth outperforms baseline models, producing high-resolution, temporally consistent spectrograms that align closely with real-world data. These findings indicate the potential of generative-based data augmentation as a scalable and cost-effective solution for bridge monitoring scenarios where rare events, such as prestressing wire breakage, suffer from data scarcity.</p></details> |  |

In this chapter, we provide an introduction to approximate inference techniques as Bayesian computation methods applied to deep learning models, with a focus on Bayesian neural networks and deep generative models. We review two arguably most popular approximate Bayesian computational methods, stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) and variational inference (VI), and explain their unique challenges in posterior inference as well as the solutions when applied to deep learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Handb...</summary><p>Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, 2nd Edition (in press, expected 2025/26, refereed chapter)</p></details> |

We address this challenge using a deep learning approach but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology: positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across large, sparsely annotated landscapes.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

The adoption of vision-based harvesting robots can significantly improve productivity while reduce reliance on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing environments. To address this, we constructed a dataset to facilitate lychee detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images, consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three representative deep learning models to evaluate the dataset. It is publicly available for academic</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Two-level MCMC Framework to Accelerate Posterior Mean Estimation with Deep Learning Surrogates for Bayesian Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01463v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems arise in various scientific and engineering domains, and solving them can be computationally demanding. This is especially the case for problems governed by partial differential equations, where the repeated evaluation of the forward operator is extremely expensive. Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL)-based surrogate models have shown promising potential to accelerate the solution of such problems. However, despite their ability to learn from complex data, DL-based surrogate models generally cannot match the accuracy of high-fidelity numerical models, which limits their practical applicability. We propose a novel hybrid two-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that combines the strengths of DL-based surrogate models and high-fidelity numerical solvers to {compute the posterior mean of Quantities of Interest (QoI) in} Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. The intuition is to leverage the evaluation speed of a DL-based surrogate model as the base chain, and correct its errors using a limited number of high-fidelity numerical model evaluations in a correction chain; hence its name hybrid two-level MCMC method. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we show that our approach can achieve the same accuracy as a pure numerical MCMC method while requiring only a small fraction of the computational cost. The theoretical analysis is further supported by several numerical experiments, namely a Poisson, a non-linear reaction-diffusion, and a Navier-Stokes equation. The proposed hybrid framework can be generalized to other approaches such as the ensemble Kalman filter and sequential Monte Carlo methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Fusion at Three Tiers: Physics-Driven Data Generation and Vision-Language Guidance for Brain Tumor Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09966v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate brain tumor segmentation is crucial for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning methods have made significant progress, but automatic segmentation still faces challenges, including tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. This paper proposes a three-tier fusion architecture that achieves precise brain tumor segmentation. The method processes information progressively at the pixel, feature, and semantic levels. At the pixel level, physical modeling extends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to multimodal data, including simulated ultrasound and synthetic computed tomography (CT). At the feature level, the method performs Transformer-based cross-modal feature fusion through multi-teacher collaborative distillation, integrating three expert teachers (MRI, US, CT). At the semantic level, clinical textual knowledge generated by GPT-4V is transformed into spatial guidance signals using CLIP contrastive learning and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). These three tiers together form a complete processing chain from data augmentation to feature extraction to semantic guidance. We validated the method on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020, 2021, and 2023 datasets. The model achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8665, 0.9014, and 0.8912 on the three datasets, respectively, and reduces the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) by an average of 6.57 millimeters compared with the baseline. This method provides a new paradigm for precise tumor segmentation and boundary localization.</p></details> | 31 pages,3 figures |
| **[Evaluating protein binding interfaces with PUMBA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16674v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins, and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains. In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16660v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance, we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset, but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.</p></details> | 38 Pages, 8 Figures |
| **[A Deep Learning Framework for Real-Time Image Processing in Medical Diagnostics: Enhancing Accuracy and Speed in Clinical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16611v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however, interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet, and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures, ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR. Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%, segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80 milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI integration in time-critical healthcare environments.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Feature Learning for Medical Point Clouds via State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13015v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural information. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization of irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across all tasks. The dataset is available at https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html.

The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the problem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) identification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different RF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that maintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We validate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world over-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several frequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world scenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to 99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only 26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in more difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels 1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller classification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce performance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high identification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it particularly suitable for practical drone security applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors have decided to withdraw this preprint due to internal review and authorship concerns</p></details> |

It features a palm and two mechanically identical and symmetrically arranged fingers, which can be driven independently or by a single motor. The fingertips of the fingers follow a linear motion trajectory, facilitating the grasping of objects of various sizes on a tabletop without the need to adjust the overall height of the gripper. Traditional industrial grippers with parallel gripping capabilities often exhibit an arcuate motion at the fingertips, requiring the entire robotic arm to adjust its height to avoid collisions with the tabletop. The SPD gripper, with its linear parallel gripping mechanism, effectively addresses this issue. Furthermore, the SPD gripper possesses adaptive capabilities, accommodating objects of different shapes and sizes. This paper presents the design philosophy, fundamental composition principles, and optimization analysis theory of the SPD gripper. Based on the design theory, a robotic gripper prototype was developed and tested. The experimental results demonstrate that the robotic gripper successfully achieves linear parallel gripping functionality and exhibits good adaptability. In the context of the ongoing development of embodied intelligence technologies, this robotic gripper can assist various robots in achieving effective grasping, laying a solid foundation for collecting data to enhance deep learning training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted author manuscript (AAM) for IEEE/RSJ IROS 2025. 6 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular, we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore, since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth, we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.</p></details> |  |

The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

Although traditional object detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition, we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.</p></details> | Neurocomputing |

By activating only a small subset of parameters per sample, SMoE enables significant growth in model capacity while maintaining efficiency. However, SMoE struggles to adapt to distributional shifts, leading to reduced robustness under data contamination. In this work, we introduce SymphonySMoE, a novel family of SMoE that introduces a social graph to model interactions among experts. This graph-based structure enhances the token routing process, addressing the robustness challenges that are inherent in conventional SMoE designs. SymphonySMoE is lightweight, modular, and integrates seamlessly with existing SMoE-based models such as the XMoE and the Generalist Language Model. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence demonstrating SymphonySMoE's advantages over baseline SMoE. Extensive experiments on language modeling and visual instruction tuning validate our method's effectiveness. We further highlight the scalability of SymphonySMoE to models with 4.2 and 7.4 billion parameters, showcasing its applicability in fine-tuning tasks for large-scale systems.</p></details> |  |

These devices require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance. We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor).

In many settings, memorization does not hurt generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its architecture.</p></details> | 30 pages |

However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.</p></details> | 35 pages |

This study explores students' perceptions of both tools, emphasizing usability, efficiency, and their integration into academic workflows. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed 109 students from diverse disciplines and conducted in-depth interviews with 12 participants. Quantitative analyses, including ANOVA and chi-square tests, were used to assess differences in efficiency, satisfaction, and tool preference. Qualitative insights revealed that students commonly switch between GPT and Google: using Google for credible, multi-source information and GPT for summarization, explanation, and drafting. While neither tool proved sufficient on its own, there was a strong demand for a hybrid solution. In response, we developed a prototype, a chatbot embedded within the search interface, that combines GPT's conversational capabilities with Google's reliability to enhance academic research and reduce cognitive load.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accte...</summary><p>Acctepted at the EMNLP 2025 HCI+NLP Workshop</p></details> |

Therefore, we propose \textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.}, \textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities.

| **[Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Iterative Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05605v5)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Mining Effective Pedagogical Strategies from Learner-LLM Educational Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17698v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dialogue plays a crucial role in educational settings, yet existing evaluation methods for educational applications of large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on technical performance or learning outcomes, often neglecting attention to learner-LLM interactions. To narrow this gap, this AIED Doctoral Consortium paper presents an ongoing study employing a dialogue analysis approach to identify effective pedagogical strategies from learner-LLM dialogues. The proposed approach involves dialogue data collection, dialogue act (DA) annotation, DA pattern mining, and predictive model building. Early insights are outlined as an initial step toward future research. The work underscores the need to evaluate LLM-based educational applications by focusing on dialogue dynamics and pedagogical strategies.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST (CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference (content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs, narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50%. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing its importance for future NLP research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (Paper under review)</p></details> |

With the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://www.prophetarena.co/</p></details> |
| **[PsyMem: Fine-grained psychological alignment and Explicit Memory Control for Advanced Role-Playing LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12814v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-M...</summary><p>Pre-MIT Press publication version, has been accepted by TACL</p></details> |

However, existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft, a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive applications.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Poster |
| **[Does Math Reasoning Improve General LLM Capabilities? Understanding Transferability of LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00432v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates: (i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with 600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components). We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe, executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is funded by the project called "Research and Development of a Highly Automated and Safe Streamlined Process for Increasing Lithium-ion Battery Repurposing and Recycling" (REBELION) under Grant 101104241, and partially supported by the Ministry of National Education, Republic of Turkey.

We introduce DeTAILS, a toolkit that integrates large language model (LLM) assistance into a workflow inspired by Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis framework. DeTAILS supports researchers in generating and refining codes, reviewing clusters, and synthesizing themes through interactive feedback loops designed to preserve analytic agency. We evaluated the system with 18 qualitative researchers analyzing Reddit data. Quantitative results showed strong alignment between LLM-supported outputs and participants' refinements, alongside reduced workload and high perceived usefulness. Qualitatively, participants reported that DeTAILS accelerated analysis, prompted reflexive engagement with AI outputs, and fostered trust through transparency and control. We contribute: (1) an interactive human-LLM workflow for large-scale qualitative analysis, (2) empirical evidence of its feasibility and researcher experience, and (3) design implications for trustworthy AI-assisted qualitative research.</p></details> |  |

In particular, role-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity, often give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms and diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both effective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how role-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal intervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how role-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the ranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in early layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while receiving limited interaction with query or document representations. Specifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information critical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on the inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for designing more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader opportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications.</p></details> |  |

While post-training quantization techniques effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads. To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. FlexQuant provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained precision management. Evaluations demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Traditional stress management tools often rely on static scripts or passive content, which are ineffective in alleviating stress. NieNie addresses this gap by combining rhythm biofeedback with real-time psychological guidance through a large language model (LLM), offering an interactive, tactile response. The system is specifically designed for young people experiencing emotional stress, collecting physiological signals such as heart rate variability and generating adaptive squeeze-release rhythms via soft, tactile devices. Utilising LLM, the system provides timely squeezing rhythms and psychologically guided feedback prompts, offering personalised rhythm games while reinforcing stress restructuring. Unlike traditional mental health apps, NieNie places users within an embodied interactive loop, leveraging tactile interaction, biofeedback, and adaptive language support to create an immersive stress regulation experience. This study demonstrates how embodied systems can connect bodily actions with mental health in everyday contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[OncoReason: Structuring Clinical Reasoning in LLMs for Robust and Interpretable Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17532v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1) standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watch the Weights: Unsupervised monitoring and control of fine-tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00161v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution. In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations, thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during fine-tuning with high precision. For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney prompt generation. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/fjzzq2002/WeightWatch.</p></details> |  |

However, how to translate the research on general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems" to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning, and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally, we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.</p></details> |  |

Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care (MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for healthcare.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Certified Self-Consistency: Statistical Guarantees and Test-Time Training for Reliable Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17472v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances such as self-consistency and test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) without additional supervision, yet their underlying mechanisms and statistical guarantees remain poorly understood. We present a unified framework for certifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a statistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the aggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution with high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration bounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority Certificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when sufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free post-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution by exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of samples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new post-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between sharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central test-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single statistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR-APT: Reconstructing APT Stories from Audit Logs using Subgraph Anomaly Detection and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15188v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy cyberattacks that often evade detection in system-level audit logs. Provenance graphs model these logs as connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories. Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors' extended version of the paper accepted for publication at the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2025).

| **[LLM as GNN: Graph Vocabulary Learning for Text-Attributed Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03313v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Generative Credit Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02298v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies.

We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives.

Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).</p></details> |  |

However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs, leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss; 2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Localist LLMs with Recruitment Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17358v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained, within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust LLM Training Infrastructure at ByteDance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16293v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wisdom is Knowing What not to Say: Hallucination-Free LLMs Unlearning via Attention Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17210v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs). Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS) framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1) context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods, achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.</p></details> | 45 pages, 12 figures |

A lightweight simulator with hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and pass@3.

Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have become a key form of graph-structured data in modern data management and analytics, combining structural relationships with rich textual semantics for diverse applications. However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |
| **[Do LLMs Recognize Your Latent Preferences? A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17132v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation? We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLUR: A Bi-Level Optimization Approach for LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08164v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling large language models (LLMs) to unlearn knowledge and capabilities acquired during training has proven vital for ensuring compliance with data regulations and promoting ethical practices in generative AI. Although there are growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains unclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular formulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads to performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and retain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the hierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem (which \textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority over the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical structure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the lower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the upper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new formulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning (\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but more importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and metrics.

| **[Leveraging Robust Optimization for LLM Alignment under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05831v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference alignment methods are increasingly critical for steering large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs consistent with human values. While recent approaches often rely on synthetic data generated by LLMs for scalability and cost-efficiency reasons, this reliance can introduce distribution shifts that undermine the nuanced representation of human preferences needed for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment despite such shifts. Our approach first leverages well-learned classifiers to assign a calibration value to each training sample, quantifying its alignment with the target human-preferred distribution. These values are then incorporated into a robust optimization objective that minimizes the worst-case loss over regions of the data space most relevant to human preferences. By explicitly focusing optimization on the target distribution, our approach mitigates the impact of distributional mismatch and improves the generation of responses that better reflect intended values.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Our key idea is to impose syntactic and semantic biases on programs generated by LLMs, such that the synthesized program is more amenable to automated verification. Based on this idea, we propose a novel specification-verification tool, built on top of Verified Software Toolchain, that help automate the process. Our experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks drawn from the deductive program synthesis community, shows that this approach is scalable and extensible. The benchmarks constitute of specifications comprising of basic coding examples, Separation Logic based assertions, and API specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17057v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Our approach harnesses the capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlights)</p></details> |

Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings, showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ZQS1943/SafeSearch</p></details> |

When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay. We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling efficiency with fairness preserved.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL-PLUS: Countering Capability Boundary Collapse of LLMs in Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid-policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00222v4)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.</p></details> |  |

Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning.

While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual, and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits, including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vocab Diet: Reshaping the Vocabulary of LLMs with Vector Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17001v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking", "Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors -- additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces. Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to 10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bits Leaked per Query: Information-Theoretic Bounds on Adversarial Attacks against LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17000v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks by malicious users that threaten the safety of large language models (LLMs) can be viewed as attempts to infer a target property $T$ that is unknown when an instruction is issued, and becomes knowable only after the model's reply is observed. Examples of target properties $T$ include the binary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the degree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both elicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \emph{observable signal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response containing answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of information leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled guidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this gap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information can be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods come to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between the observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query, we show that achieving error $\varepsilon$ requires at least $\log(1/\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak rate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest increase in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic in terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across system-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the theory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding logits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process trims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for balancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[DOGe: Defensive Output Generation for LLM Protection Against Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19504v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model imitation via knowledge distillation (KD). In practical scenarios, competitors can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access. We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe) strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs are accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving the performance of the teacher model, student models distilled from the defensively generated outputs demonstrate catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating DOGe as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/unites-lab/doge</p></details> |
| **[Lark: Biologically Inspired Neuroevolution for Multi-Stakeholder LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16978v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Lark, a biologically inspired decision-making framework that couples LLM-driven reasoning with an evolutionary, stakeholder-aware Multi-Agent System (MAS). To address verbosity and stakeholder trade-offs, we integrate four mechanisms: (i) plasticity, which applies concise adjustments to candidate solutions; (ii) duplication and maturation, which copy high-performing candidates and specialize them into new modules; (iii) ranked-choice stakeholder aggregation using influence-weighted Borda scoring; and (iv) compute awareness via token-based penalties that reward brevity. The system iteratively proposes diverse strategies, applies plasticity tweaks, simulates stakeholder evaluations, aggregates preferences, selects top candidates, and performs duplication/maturation while factoring compute cost into final scores. In a controlled evaluation over 30 rounds comparing 14 systems, Lark Full achieves a mean rank of 2.55 (95% CI [2.17, 2.93]) and a mean composite score of 29.4/50 (95% CI [26.34, 32.46]), finishing Top-3 in 80% of rounds while remaining cost competitive with leading commercial models ($0.016 per task). Paired Wilcoxon tests confirm that all four mechanisms contribute significantly as ablating duplication/maturation yields the largest deficit ({\Delta}Score = 3.5, Cohen's d_z = 2.53, p < 0.001), followed by plasticity ({\Delta}Score = 3.4, d_z = 1.86), ranked-choice voting ({\Delta}Score = 2.4, d_z = 1.20), and token penalties ({\Delta}Score = 2.2, d_z = 1.63). Rather than a formal Markov Decision Process with constrained optimization, Lark is a practical, compute-aware neuroevolutionary loop that scales stakeholder-aligned strategy generation and makes trade-offs transparent through per-step metrics. Our work presents proof-of-concept findings and invites community feedback as we expand toward real-world validation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Efficient Reasoning</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce $Q\sharp$, a value-based algorithm for KL-regularized RL that guides the reference policy using the optimal regularized $Q$ function. We propose to learn the optimal $Q$ function using distributional RL on an aggregated online dataset. Unlike prior value-based baselines that guide the model using unregularized $Q$-values, our method is theoretically principled and provably learns the optimal policy for the KL-regularized RL problem. Empirically, $Q\sharp$ outperforms prior baselines in math reasoning benchmarks while maintaining a smaller KL divergence to the reference policy. Theoretically, we establish a reduction from KL-regularized RL to no-regret online learning, providing the first bounds for deterministic MDPs under only realizability. Thanks to distributional RL, our bounds are also variance-dependent and converge faster when the reference policy has small variance. In sum, our results highlight $Q\sharp$ as an effective approach for post-training LLMs, offering both improved performance and theoretical guarantees. The code can be found at https://github.com/jinpz/q_sharp.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Peering Inside the Black Box: Uncovering LLM Errors in Optimization Modelling through Component-Level Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16943v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error (RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability. Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained, diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tutoring LLM into a Better CUDA Optimizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16933v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent leaps in large language models (LLMs) caused a revolution in programming tools (like GitHub Copilot) that can help with code generation, debugging, and even performance optimization. In this paper, we focus on the capabilities of the most recent reasoning models to generate optimized CUDA code for predefined, well-known tasks. Our objective is to determine which types of code optimizations and parallel patterns the LLMs can perform by themselves and whether they can be improved by tutoring (providing more detailed hints and guidelines in the prompt). The generated solutions were evaluated both automatically (for correctness and speedup) and manually (code reviews) to provide a more detailed perspective. We also tried an interactive approach where the LLM can fix its previous mistakes within a session. The results indicate that LLMs are quite skilled coders; however, they require tutoring to reach optimized solutions provided by parallel computing experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Prompt-MII: Meta-Learning Instruction Induction for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16932v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[SolverLLM: Leveraging Test-Time Scaling for Optimization Problem via LLM-Guided Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16916v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code, guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization without additional training.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

| **[Utility-Diversity Aware Online Batch Selection for LLM Supervised Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16882v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning.

| **[PrediQL: Automated Testing of GraphQL APIs with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10407v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GraphQL's flexible query model and nested data dependencies expose APIs to complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are difficult to uncover using conventional testing tools. Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages, and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.</p></details> | 8 pages, two columns |

We introduce a two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA. Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently, for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of 22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Many-Shot Prompting Fails: An Empirical Study of LLM Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16809v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot" prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Enhanced Black-Litterman Portfolio Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14345v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Black-Litterman model addresses the sensitivity issues of tra- ditional mean-variance optimization by incorporating investor views, but systematically generating these views remains a key challenge. This study proposes and validates a systematic frame- work that translates return forecasts and predictive uncertainty from Large Language Models (LLMs) into the core inputs for the Black-Litterman model: investor views and their confidence lev- els. Through a backtest on S&P 500 constituents, we demonstrate that portfolios driven by top-performing LLMs significantly out- perform traditional baselines in both absolute and risk-adjusted terms. Crucially, our analysis reveals that each LLM exhibits a dis- tinct and consistent investment style which is the primary driver of performance. We found that the selection of an LLM is therefore not a search for a single best forecaster, but a strategic choice of an investment style whose success is contingent on its alignment with the prevailing market regime.

| **[Black-box Optimization of LLM Outputs by Asking for Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16794v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach for attacking black-box large language models (LLMs) by exploiting their ability to express confidence in natural language. Existing black-box attacks require either access to continuous model outputs like logits or confidence scores (which are rarely available in practice), or rely on proxy signals from other models. Instead, we demonstrate how to prompt LLMs to express their internal confidence in a way that is sufficiently calibrated to enable effective adversarial optimization. We apply our general method to three attack scenarios: adversarial examples for vision-LLMs, jailbreaks and prompt injections. Our attacks successfully generate malicious inputs against systems that only expose textual outputs, thereby dramatically expanding the attack surface for deployed LLMs. We further find that better and larger models exhibit superior calibration when expressing confidence, creating a concerning security paradox where model capability improvements directly enhance vulnerability. Our code is available at this [link](https://github.com/zj-jayzhang/black_box_llm_optimization).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15594v6)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://awesome-llm-as-a-judge.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[When To Solve, When To Verify: Compute-Optimal Problem Solving and Generative Verification for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01005v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification. The code is available at https://github.com/nishadsinghi/sc-genrm-scaling.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |
| **[An Empirical Study on LLM-based Agents for Automated Bug Fixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10213v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based Agents have been applied to fix bugs automatically, demonstrating the capability in addressing software defects by engaging in development environment interaction, iterative validation and code modification. However, systematic analysis of these agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18439v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable. This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.

| **[T3 Planner: A Self-Correcting LLM Framework for Robotic Motion Planning with Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16767v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language instructions into executable motion plans is a fundamental challenge in robotics. Traditional approaches are typically constrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize planners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead to infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion execution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion plans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic motion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The framework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded modules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory sequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) verifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical constraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3 Planner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be distilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.

| **[Intrinsic Self-Correction in LLMs: Towards Explainable Prompting via Mechanistic Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11924v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic self-correction refers to the phenomenon where a language model refines its own outputs purely through prompting, without external feedback or parameter updates. While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its internal mechanism remains poorly understood. We analyze intrinsic self-correction from a representation-level perspective. We formalize and introduce the notion of a prompt-induced shift, which is the change in hidden representations caused by a self-correction prompt. Across 5 open-source LLMs, prompt-induced shifts in text detoxification and text toxification align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These results suggest that intrinsic self-correction functions as representation steering along interpretable latent directions, beyond what standard metrics such as task scores or model confidence capture. Our analysis offers an interpretability-based account of intrinsic self-correction and contributes to a more systematic understanding of LLM prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentAuditor: Human-Level Safety and Security Evaluation for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00641v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce AgentAuditor, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. AgentAuditor constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed ASSEBench, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. ASSEBench comprises 2293 meticulously annotated interaction records, covering 15 risk types across 29 application scenarios. A key feature of ASSEBench is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing "Strict" and "Lenient" judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that AgentAuditor not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly accessible at https://github.com/Astarojth/AgentAuditor.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[DistilLock: Safeguarding LLMs from Unauthorized Knowledge Distillation on the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16716v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, but fine-tuning them typically relies on cloud-based, centralized infrastructures. This requires data owners to upload potentially sensitive data to external servers, raising serious privacy concerns. An alternative approach is to fine-tune LLMs directly on edge devices using local data; however, this introduces a new challenge: the model owner must transfer proprietary models to the edge, which risks intellectual property (IP) leakage. To address this dilemma, we propose DistilLock, a TEE-assisted fine-tuning framework that enables privacy-preserving knowledge distillation on the edge. In DistilLock, a proprietary foundation model is executed within a trusted execution environment (TEE) enclave on the data owner's device, acting as a secure black-box teacher. This setup preserves both data privacy and model IP by preventing direct access to model internals. Furthermore, DistilLock employs a model obfuscation mechanism to offload obfuscated weights to untrusted accelerators for efficient knowledge distillation without compromising security. We demonstrate that DistilLock prevents unauthorized knowledge distillation processes and model-stealing attacks while maintaining high computational efficiency, but offering a secure and practical solution for edge-based LLM personalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[so much depends / upon / a whitespace: Why Whitespace Matters for Poets and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16713v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different text processing methods can result in significantly different representations of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble pretraining datasets for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Chameleon Nature of LLMs: Quantifying Multi-Turn Stance Instability in Search-Enabled Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16712v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising 17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511), with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes (r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for reliable decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision for Access Control in LLM-based Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11108v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2) adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[An Agentic Framework with LLMs for Solving Complex Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16701v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge, demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility, achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Efficiency and Exploration in Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18573v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However, existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers. Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems, enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover potential correct pathways.
